"You can use any flavor of Kool-Aid for the Kool-Aid Marshmallows, but Tropical Punch is recommended for a vibrant hot pink color. 

Here’s the recipe for **Kool-Aid Marshmallows**:

### Ingredients
- 1 (.16-ounce) packet unsweetened Kool-Aid drink mix, any flavor
- 1/2 cup cold water
- 5 teaspoons unflavored powdered gelatin
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup light corn syrup, divided
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup Classic Coating, plus more for dusting
- 4 packets Pop Rocks, for sprinkling (optional)

### Instructions
1. Lightly coat an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
2. Whisk together the Kool-Aid mix, cold water, and gelatin in a small bowl. Let it soften for 5 minutes.
3. Stir together the sugar, 1/4 cup of the corn syrup, water, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring the syrup to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 240°F. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup corn syrup into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Microwave the gelatin on high until completely melted, about 30 seconds, and pour it into the mixer bowl. Set the mixer to low and keep it running.
4. When the syrup reaches 240°F, slowly pour it into the mixer bowl. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes. Increase to medium-high and beat for 5 more minutes.

"To prepare the chocolate glaze after the cake has cooled, follow the instructions below:

### Ingredients:
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon powdered instant espresso or coffee
- 1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

### Instructions:
1. Bring the cream to a near boil in a small saucepan. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla or espresso powder. Immediately add the chocolate chips. Tilt the pan this way and that so the hot cream runs over them. Set the pan aside for 5 minutes, then stir the mixture briefly to start smoothing it out.

2. Let the mixture rest for another 2 to 3 minutes, then whisk briefly until smooth. The glaze will be a little runny at first, perfect for drizzling on pound cakes and Bundt-type cakes. If you want slightly thicker coverage, such as on a cheesecake or sheet cake, you can let the glaze cool slightly before spreading it. If the sauce cools and starts to thicken and you need to rewarm it to thin it out, heat it very gently in a saucepan. You can also reheat it in a microwavable container, but proceed carefully so you don’t burn the chocolate—microwave for no more than 15 seconds at a time, stirring between each round.

"The provided context does not directly answer the question regarding when to add an additional egg to the dough mixture. However, generally, you may want to add an additional egg if the dough seems too dry or doesn’t come together properly. 

For a detailed recipe about a dough that includes eggs, you might check the **Egg Noodle** recipe, where it specifies using 2 whole eggs and 4 egg yolks for the mixture. If you find that your dough is too crumbly or stiff, incorporating an additional egg can help achieve a better consistency.

### Egg Noodle
**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup semolina flour (plus extra for the board)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- plus 4 egg yolks, beaten together

**Instructions:**
1. In a large bowl, mix the flours and salt.
2. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the eggs. Whisk them, gradually pulling in flour from the rim, until the mixture comes together. (It will be very firm; add a few drops of water if it seems crumbly.)
3. Turn the dough out onto a semolina-dusted board. Work it with your hands until it's just smooth, about 5 to 10 minutes—it should spring back slightly when you poke it with your finger.
4. Wrap it in plastic and let it sit for 1 hour (or refrigerate it for up to a day).
5. Boil a large pot of salted water. Roll the dough out on the semolina-dusted board until it's paper-thin. Slice it into wide strips, any width you like.
6. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute past the point when they rise to the top, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and serve.

"To let the yeast mixture stand until it starts to foam for the Kouign-Amann, you should let it stand for **about 5 minutes**.

### Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons (30 g) European-style butter (at least 82% fat), melted, slightly cooled, plus more for bowl
- 1 tablespoon (10 g) active dry yeast
- 3 cups (400 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
- 3 tablespoons (40 g) sugar
- 1 teaspoon (5 g) kosher salt
- 12 ounces (340 g) chilled unsalted European-style butter (at least 82% fat), cut into pieces
- 1/2 cup (100 g) sugar
- 1 teaspoon (5 g) kosher salt
- All-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup (150 g) sugar, divided
- Nonstick vegetable oil spray

### Instructions:
1. Brush a large bowl with butter. Whisk yeast and 1/4 cup very warm water (110°F–115°F) in another large bowl to dissolve. Let stand until yeast starts to foam, about 5 minutes. Add 3 cups flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons butter, and 3/4 cup cold water. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding flour as needed, until dough is supple, soft, and slightly tacky, about 5 minutes.
2. Place dough in prepared bowl and turn to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, place in a warm, draft-free spot, and let dough rise until doubled in size, 1–1 1/2 hours. (This process of resting and rising is known as proofing.) Punch down dough and knead lightly a few times inside bowl. Cover again with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until dough is again doubled in size, 45–60 minutes.
3. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a 6x6"" square. Wrap in plastic and chill in freezer until dough is very firm but not frozen, 30–35 minutes. (Heads up: You'll want it to be about as firm as the chilled butter block in step 5.)
4. Beat 12 ounces butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt with an electric mixer on low speed just until homogeneous and waxy-looking, about 3 minutes. Scrape butter mixture onto a large sheet of parchment. Shape into a 12x6"" rectangle 1/4"" thick.
5. Neatly wrap up butter, pressing out air. Roll packet gently with a rolling pin to push butter into corners and create an evenly thick rectangle. Chill in refrigerator until firm but pliable, 25–30 minutes.
6. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface into a 19x7"" rectangle (a bit wider and about 50 percent longer than the butter block). Place butter block on upper two-thirds of dough, leaving a thin border along top and sides. Fold dough like a letter: Bring lower third of dough up and over lower half of butter. Then fold exposed upper half of butter and dough over lower half (butter should bend, not break). Press edges of dough to seal, enclosing butter.
7. Rotate dough package 90°F counterclockwise so flap opening is on your right. Roll out dough, dusting with flour as needed, to a 24x8"" rectangle about 3/8"" thick. Fold rectangle into thirds like a letter (as in step 6), bringing lower third up, then upper third down (this completes the first turn). Dust dough lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and chill in freezer until firm but not frozen, about 30 minutes. Transfer to refrigerator; continue to chill until very firm, about 1 hour longer.
8. Place dough on surface so flap opening is on your right. Roll out dough, dusting with flour as needed, to a 24x8"" rectangle, about 3/8"" thick. Fold into thirds (same way as before), rotate 90°F counterclockwise so flap opening is on your right, and roll out again to a 24x8"" rectangle. Sprinkle surface of dough with 2 tablespoons sugar; fold into thirds. Dust lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and chill in freezer until firm but not frozen, about 30 minutes. Transfer to refrigerator; continue to chill until very firm, about 1 hour longer.

"To cut the dough without a chitarra, you can simply use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter. Roll out the dough into the desired thickness, and then roll it into a log shape. Using your knife or pizza cutter, slice the log into equal pieces to form your noodles or pasta shapes. This method would be effective for the Extra-Flaky Pastry Dough outlined below:

### Extra-Flaky Pastry Dough

**Ingredients:**
- 1 1/2 tsp. sugar
- 3/4 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 1/3 cups (180 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
- 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter

**Instructions:**
1. Whisk sugar, salt, and 1 1/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Cut butter into 6 rectangular pieces (if using 1/2-cup sticks, cut them in half crosswise, then in half again lengthwise). Toss butter in dry ingredients to coat, then dump mixture out onto a work surface. Roll butter into flour until it is in long flexible strips, using a bench scraper to scrape butter off rolling pin or surface as needed.
2. Use bench scraper to gather mixture into a loose pile, then drizzle 4 Tbsp. ice water over. Using your hands and the bench scraper, toss mixture until water is distributed, then gather into a rectangular pile. Roll out dough to a long rectangle with short ends about 8"" wide, then use bench scraper to fold dough into thirds, like folding a letter. It will be very crumbly and loose; don’t panic. Using bench scraper to help, turn rectangle 90° and repeat rolling and folding, gathering loose bits of dough from outer edges into the center and flouring surface as needed. Repeat rolling and folding a third time. Dough should be somewhat homogenous and creamy-looking with some dry bits around edges. Squeeze a bit in your palm; it should loosely hold together. If not, repeat rolling and folding. Wrap folded dough in plastic, then press it into a compact disk about 1"" thick. Chill 30 minutes.
3. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12""–14"" round or oval about 1/8"" thick (don’t worry about cracks around perimeter). Dust surface and rolling pin with flour as needed and rotate dough often to prevent wider cracks. If dough sticks to surface, lift on one side and scatter flour underneath before continuing. Roll dough onto your pin, then unfurl it on a sheet of parchment paper. Slide onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you prep the filling.
4. Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling out.

"For **The Ischler**, after adding the remaining ingredients, you should simmer the mixture for **10-15 minutes** until it becomes deep orange and thick.

### Ingredients:
* 2 cups sliced almonds, preferably unblanched
* 1 cup plus 2 tbsp powdered sugar
* 16 tbsp unsalted butter, softened (2 sticks)
* 1/2 large egg, lightly beaten
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 3/4 cups plus 1 tbsp bleached all-purpose flour
* 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
* 2 2/3 cups dried apricots (1 lb)
* 1 cup plus 2 tbsp granulated sugar
* 2 tsp lemon zest, finely grated
* 1 tsp apricot or peach brandy
* 8 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped
* 1/4 cup heavy cream, hot
* Nut grater; 2 1/2"" round cookie cutters

### Instructions:
1. Grate almonds using a nut grater.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with flat beater, beat almonds, powdered sugar, and butter until fluffy. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add egg and vanilla; beat until blended.
3. Whisk together flour and salt. On low speed, gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture. Mix until incorporated and dough begins to come away from sides of bowl.
4. Scrape mixture into a plastic bag and press it together. Remove dough from bag and transfer to a large sheet of plastic wrap. Use the edges of the wrap to knead dough until smooth.
5. Divide dough into quarters. Wrap with plastic and flatten into disks. Place in freezer bag. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
6. In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, soak dried apricots in 2 cups water for 2 hours. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 20-30 minutes on the lowest heat until apricots are very soft. If water evaporates, add a little extra.
7. In a food processor, pulse apricots and liquid with sugar, lemon zest, and brandy.
8. Return mixture to saucepan and simmer, stirring, 10-15 minutes, until deep orange and thick.
9. Transfer to a bowl; let cool. (You will need only about 2/3 cup, but the leftover will keep almost indefinitely when refrigerated.)
10. Preheat oven to 350°.
11. Set 1 dough disk on a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour dough and re-cover it with plastic wrap. Let dough soften until malleable, about 10 minutes. Roll 1/8"" thick, adding more flour if necessary to keep dough from sticking.
12. Cut out 20 cookies. Place 1/2"" apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. (Set aside scraps; cover with plastic wrap.) Bake cookies 4 minutes. Rotate the cookie sheet then continue baking for 2-6 minutes, or until edges brown.
13. Let cookies cool on a wire rack.
14. Repeat process with remaining dough disks. (After the last batch is cut, you can knead together all the scraps and repeat chilling, rerolling, and cutting.)
15. Heat chocolate in a bowl set over hot water (not touching), stirring with a silicone spatula, until almost completely melted. Remove from heat and stir until fully melted.
16. Add cream; stir until smooth. (The mixture should drop thickly from the spatula. If the ganache thickens before it's used, reheat in the microwave in 3-second bursts.) Set aside.
17. Spread bottoms of half of the cookies with a thin layer of apricot filling. Spread bottoms of the remaining cookies with a slightly thicker ganache layer. Set the chocolate cookies, coated side down, on the apricot cookies. Let sit for a minimum of 30 minutes.
18. Store airtight at room temperature, 5 days; frozen, 6 months.

"Chilling the crust before baking is an important step because it helps to solidify the fat in the dough, which results in a flakier texture once baked. This chilling process also prevents the crust from shrinking during baking and helps maintain its shape. By refrigerating the dough, you ensure that the layers of fat remain intact and do not melt prematurely, which is crucial for achieving the desired texture in a pastry crust.

Here is the recipe for the **No-Stress All-Butter Pastry Crust**:

### Ingredients:
- 1 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon | 8 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting
- 1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
- 2 sticks (8 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1/2 cup (4 ounces) cold water

### Instructions:
1. Sift flour into a medium bowl (if using cup measures, spoon into the cups and level with a knife before sifting). Whisk in sugar and salt. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes, no smaller, and toss with flour to break up the pieces. Roughly smash each cube flat—nothing more! Stir in cold water and knead until the dough comes together in a ball. With a dough temperature at or below 70°F, it will feel dry to the touch.
  
2. Transfer to a generously floured work space, sprinkle with more flour, and roll into a 10-by-15-inch sheet. Fold each 10-inch side toward the middle, and close the packet like a book. Fold top to bottom to make a thick block, then cut in half. Using as much flour as needed, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Brush off excess flour, drape over a 9-inch tempered glass pie plate, making sure it’s flush against the pan.
  
3. Trim excess dough into a 1 1/4-inch overhang all around, then fold over to create a 3/4-inch border that sits on the rim of the plate; if positioned inside the rim, the crust will be too shallow to accommodate the filling. Pinch or press the border into a zigzag pattern, and repeat with remaining dough. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight. Alternately, formed crusts can be frozen up to 3 months and thawed in a refrigerator before use.
  
4. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line the chilled crust with a large strip of foil (not parchment or wax paper), letting the excess loosely cover the rim. Fill with plain white sugar, a delicious alternative to options like rice or beans.
  
5. Bake on an aluminum baking sheet until fully set and golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and carefully lift out the foil, setting it aside until the sugar has cooled. If the sides of the crust seem puffy or pale, continue baking 10 minutes more. Cool to room temperature. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
  
6. If the temperature climbs above 73°F in your kitchen, be aware that everything from your countertop to your rolling pin and the flour itself will act as a heat source to the butter. Combat these conditions by refrigerating your pie plate, rolling pin, and dry ingredients until cool—not cold or frozen. If needed, chill the countertops of a sweltering hot kitchen with bags of ice water.

"For the **Wild Garlic and White Bean Curry**, you can use either **2 cups of shelled fresh coco beans** or **1 cup of cooked dried cannellini beans**. If you're using dried beans, they should be cooked before adding them to the curry.

### Ingredients
- 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced
- 1 ½ tsp coriander seeds
- 1 tsp yellow mustard seeds
- 1 tsp fenugreek seeds
- Seeds from 5 cardamom pods
- 3 fresh red chiles (or more if you like heat), sliced (seeded if you prefer less heat)
- 12 fresh curry leaves
- 6 kaffir lime leaves
- Small handful of cilantro roots, washed and minced
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
- 2 tbsp jaggery or superfine sugar
- Juice of 2 limes
- 3 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 (12-ounce) cans good-quality peeled plum tomatoes
- 2 cups shelled fresh coco beans, or 1 cup dried cannellini beans, cooked
- Generous ¾ cup coconut milk
- 10 ounces wild garlic leaves

### Instructions
1. Have the beans ready podded, or cooked if using dried beans. Heat the oil in a large heavy pan over medium-low heat and sweat the onions until soft and translucent.
2. In a separate pan, warm all the spice seeds until they release their fragrance and just begin to jump in the pan. Tip into a mortar and grind with the pestle while still warm.
3. Add the warm ground spices to the softened onions along with the chiles, curry leaves, lime leaves, and minced cilantro root. Cook for another 5 minutes over fairly low heat, then add the crushed garlic, jaggery, lime juice, and fish sauce. Stir well and cook for 5 minutes.
4. Add the tomatoes, stir well, and cook for another 10 minutes, then add the fresh or cooked dried beans and coconut milk. Cook gently for 10 to 15 minutes (or until the beans are tender if cooking fresh).
5. While the curry is cooking, wash the wild garlic very well, picking over each leaf thoroughly for they can carry little stones.
6. A couple of minutes before serving the curry, add the wild garlic and cook until it is just wilted and soft. Don't overcook it—wild garlic should be bright and vibrant. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. This curry should be soft, fragrant, gently sweet, sharp, and salty, with just enough heat to warm you.

"In the sautéed chicken recipe, if you need a substitute for white balsamic vinegar, you could consider using **distilled white vinegar** as an alternative. This substitute will work similarly due to its acidic properties, although the flavor will differ slightly. 

Here are the ingredients for the recipe featuring distilled white vinegar:

### Ingredients:
* 2 cups distilled white vinegar
* 1 cup sunflower oil, plus more for frying
* 1/4 cup kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 10 dashes of Tabasco chipotle pepper sauce
* 1 tablespoon smoked sweet paprika
* 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
* 4 garlic cloves, peeled
* 1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), cut into 4 pieces (2 whole breasts and 2 whole legs)
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions:
1. In a blender, combine the vinegar, 1 cup of the oil, salt, cayenne, chipotle pepper sauce, smoked paprika, black pepper, and garlic and blend until smooth. (Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender to blend the marinade.) Pour the marinade into a gallon-size plastic bag and toss in the chicken pieces.

- 1 pound fresh or frozen cauliflower florets
- 4 ounces extra-sharp Cheddar
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese or other cheese of your choice like Gruyere

### Instructions
1. Pour the pasta into the Instant Pot and add the water, soy sauce, mustard, and salt. Stir well to combine, then add the cauliflower on top without stirring, making sure that the cauliflower layer completely covers the pasta for even cooking.

When the oil is hot, add some of the pieces of pork and sear until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining pork. When all the pork has been browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots. Cook, stirring, until the shallots are softened, about 2 minutes, then add the ginger, garlic, and chilies and cook 1 minute more. Return the pork and any accumulated juices to the pot and add the caramel sauce and coconut water. The pieces of meat should poke up above the level of the liquid; if they’re completely submerged, transfer the meat and liquid to a different pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid is simmering. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven.
3. After 15 minutes of cooking, uncover the pot; the liquid should be simmering gently. If it’s bubbling too vigorously, reduce the oven temperature to 275°F. Cook for 70 minutes—the meat should be tender but not falling apart. Uncover the pot and continue cooking for 30 minutes more, until the exposed bits of pork are caramelized and the meat is tender. Remove from the oven and serve with steamed rice.

"After forming the dough into a ball, you should let it rise for **15 minutes** covered with a tea towel before stretching it. This step helps relax the gluten, making the dough easier to handle.

### Ingredients:
* 1 1/4 cups warm water (95°)
* One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
* 3 1/2 cups of ""00"" flour
* Scant 2 tablespoons salt
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* Semolina for dusting

### Instructions:
1. Whisk the warm water, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.
2. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix well. With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and oil, mixing well. Continue to mix, gradually increasing the mixer speed to medium-high, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and give it a few turns by hand to finish kneading it; it will still be slightly sticky.
3. Alternatively, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until the mixture is too stiff to stir, then mix with your hands in the bowl until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto the lightly floured work surface and knead, adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth elastic, and only slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.
4. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. Divide it into 8 pieces (about 4 ounces each) and shape each one into a ball. Cover with a tea towel and let stand for 15 minutes before stretching the dough. Or, for easier handling, transfer the balls to a floured baking sheet and refrigerate until cold.

"To ensure that poached links of Beer Bratwurst are cooked properly, the internal temperature should reach **145°F (63°C)**. This temperature ensures that the sausages are safe to eat.

### Ingredients:
- 844 grams (1.90 pounds) boneless pork shoulder (or a combination of pork cuts, about 75% lean, 25% fat), cut into 1-in/2.5-cm cubes
- 362 grams (0.80 pound) boneless veal shoulder or breast, cut into 1-in/2.5-cm cubes
- 121 grams (1/2 cup) pale ale
- 22 grams (1 tbsp) fine sea salt
- 4 grams (1 tsp) sugar
- 2 grams (1 tsp) caraway seeds
- 1 gram (1/2 tsp) dry mustard powder
- 1 gram (1 tsp) fresh thyme leaves
- 1 gram (1/2 tsp) ground ginger
- 0.46 gram (1/4 tsp) freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 gram (1/4 tsp) Cure No. 1
- Hog casings, rinsed
- Lager-style beer for poaching (optional)

3. In a small bowl, add the salt, sugar, caraway seeds, mustard powder, thyme, ginger, nutmeg, and Cure No. 1 and stir to combine.
4. Nest a large mixing bowl in a bowl filled with ice. Grind the meat through the small die (3/16-inch/4-mm) of the grinder into the bowl set in ice. Once all of the meat has been ground, pour the semi-frozen ale through the grinder, into the bowl, which will help push out any meat remaining in the feed tube or wrapped around the auger.
5. Add the spice mixture to the meat and stir with your hands until well incorporated; the mixture will look homogenous and will begin sticking to the bowl.
6. Spoon 2 tbsp of the meat mixture into a nonstick frying pan and spread into a thin patty. Cook the test patty over low heat until cooked through but not browned. Taste the sausage for seasoning and adjust as necessary.
7. Press a sheet of parchment paper or plastic wrap directly on the surface of the meat to prevent oxidation, then cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Alternatively, you can vacuum-seal the mixture.
8. Stuff the sausage into the hog casings and twist into links.
9. Poach the links in water or lager-style beer until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the sausage registers 145°F/63°C.

"To sauté the shallots before adding the coffee in the recipe you provided, you should sauté them for about **8 minutes** until they are light golden brown. This timing is based on the ""Crispy Fried Shallots"" recipe, where you cook the shallots in oil to achieve that golden color.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups thinly sliced shallots (about 4 large shallots)
- 2 cups canola oil

### Instructions
1. In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high until it registers 275°F on a deep-fry thermometer. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until light golden brown, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallots to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

"If you don't have a scale to measure the schmaltz for the Chicken Sausage recipe, you can use a scant cup as a substitute. Here are the ingredients and instructions for the Chicken Sausage recipe:

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pound/675 grams chicken thigh meat, diced and thoroughly chilled
- 225 grams schmaltz, frozen (or a scant cup if you don't have a scale, but shame on you)
- 1 tablespoon/10-12 grams kosher salt
- 3/4 cup roughly chopped fresh sage
- 2 large garlic cloves, finely minced
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped ginger
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- 1/2 cup/120 milliliters dry white wine, chilled

### Instructions
1. Combine all the ingredients except the wine in a large bowl and freeze for 20 to 30 minutes. Measure the wine and put that in the freezer too. If your grinder attachment is metal, freeze that as well, and also your mixing bowl. Set up your grinder, remove the chicken mixture from the freezer, and grind it through a small or medium die into the freezing-cold mixing bowl. Return the meat to the freezer for 10 minutes and set up your stand mixer.

2. Remove the sausage mixture from the freezer and mix it with the paddle attachment on medium high for 60 seconds or so, adding the very cold white wine as you do. Paddling will distribute the seasonings and give the sausage a good bind help hold together rather than crumble. In order to be sure the seasoning is right, fry a small portion of the sausage (put the mixing bowl in the fridge while you cook the test piece). Taste the test piece. If you think the mix needs more salt, pepper, sage or ginger add it and repaddle it. You can do this as often as you like till you get the seasoning just so.

3. Wrap the sausage in plastic wrap in the shape of a cylinder, about 2-1/2 inches/7.5 centimeters in diameter. Put the wrapped sausage in a plastic bag. It will last a good week in the fridge (thanks to the salt); it can be frozen for 3 months (the longer you freeze it, though, the more chance it has of getting freezer burn or picking up unpleasant freezer odors, so label the bag with the date and don't forget about it).

"After baking, you should allow the cake to cool in the pan on a wire rack for **10 minutes** before inverting it onto the rack to cool completely. 

Here are the details for the Whipped Cream Cake:

### Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 cups cake flour or 2 cups all purpose flour, sifted (measured by sifting into the cup and leveling it off)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, cold
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons superfine sugar
- Special Equipment: 1 (10-cup) fluted metal tube pan coated with baking spray with flour

### Instructions:
1. Twenty minutes or more before baking, set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F (350°F if using a dark pan).
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt and then sift them together to make the mixture easier to incorporate.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk beater, whip the cream, starting on low speed, gradually raising the speed to medium-high as it thickens, until stiff peaks form when the beater is raised.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla just until lightly combined.
5. On medium-high speed, gradually beat the egg mixture into the whipped cream. The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it.
6. Detach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears. Add the rest of the flour mixture and continue folding and mixing until all traces of flour have disappeared. Using a silicone spatula or spoon, scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Run a small metal spatula or dull knife blade through the batter to prevent large air bubbles, avoiding the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small metal spatula.
7. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted between the tube and the side comes out completely clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.

"To ensure the chicken skin gets crispy while cooking the Chicken Escabèche, follow these tips based on the recipe provided:

1. **Pat the chicken dry**: Make sure the chicken is patted dry to remove excess moisture, as this helps achieve a crispy skin.
2. **Season generously**: Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. This not only enhances flavor but also helps draw out moisture from the skin, leading to crispiness.
3. **Cook skin side down first**: In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken skin side down until it is well browned and very crisp, about 8–12 minutes.
4. **Bake uncovered**: After browning, arrange the chicken skin side up in the pot and bake it uncovered. This allows for air circulation around the chicken, helping the skin to stay crisp.

Here are the complete ingredients and instructions for Chicken Escabèche:

### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
- 1/3 cup plus 2 Tbsp. olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 medium carrot, peeled, chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, smashed
- 1 bay leaf
- 2/3 cup sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- 4 chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks separated, patted dry
- 1 serrano chile, very thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup golden raisins
- 3/4 cup mint leaves

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Toast cumin and coriander seeds in a dry medium saucepan over medium heat, tossing, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1/3 cup oil, followed by onion, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent but hasn’t taken on any color, about 5 minutes. Add bay leaf, vinegar, and 1/2 cup water and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 1 minute. Remove marinade from heat; season with salt and pepper.
   
2. Season chicken generously all over with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in batches if needed, cook chicken, skin side down, in a single layer until skin is well browned and very crisp, 8–12 minutes. Turn pieces over and cook on the other side 1 minute (if cooking in batches, transfer pieces to a plate as they’re done). Return chicken to pot, arranging skin side up and nestling pieces side by side to form as even a layer as possible. Pour in marinade (meat should be mostly submerged, but you want the skin still exposed). Scatter chile and raisins over the top.

3. Transfer pot to oven and bake, uncovered, until chicken is cooked through, 10–15 minutes (an instant-read thermometer inserted into a thigh should register 165°F). Let rest 10–15 minutes, then top with mint.

"The purpose of reserving 1/2 cup of blackberries in the **Corn Flour Shortcakes with Blackberries and Whipped Cream** recipe is to use them as a garnish. These reserved blackberries are stirred into the sauce made from the initial mix of blackberries and lemon juice, and they are added just before serving. This helps in enhancing the flavor and presentation of the dessert.

### Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup (110 grams) granulated sugar, divided
* 3 large egg yolks, at room temperature
* 1/4 cup flavorless vegetable oil (such as corn or safflower)
* 1/2 cup (70 grams) corn flour
* 1/4 cup (40 grams) white rice flour (Bobs Red Mill makes a good one), 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 4 large egg whites, at room temperature
* 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 2 cups (12 ounces) fresh blackberries
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* Pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
* Stand mixer with whisk attachment or handheld electric mixer
* 9-inch square cake pan

### Instructions:
1. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper but leave the sides unlined and ungreased.
2. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the sugar for later (to stiffen the egg whites).
3. Add the remaining sugar to a large mixing bowl with egg yolks, oil, corn flour, rice flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/4 cup water. Whisk to blend thoroughly. Set aside for 15 minutes to hydrate the corn flour while the oven is heating.
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the egg whites and cream of tartar and beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is creamy white and holds a soft shape. Slowly sprinkle in the reserved 2 tablespoons sugar, beating at high speed until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Scrape half of the egg whites onto the corn batter and fold until partially blended. Add the remaining egg whites and fold just until the batter looks blended. Scrape the batter into the pan and spread it evenly.
5. Bake until the top of the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
6. Set the pan on a cooling rack. Immediately, while the cake is still hot, slide a thin knife or spatula around the sides, pressing against the pan to avoid tearing the cake. Leave the cake in the pan to cool—it will settle a bit and pull away from the edges of the pan.
7. When cool, carefully invert the cake onto a cutting board. Cut the cake into 8 even rectangles, about 2x4-inches each.
8. In a medium bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups of the blackberries with the lemon juice. Let stand for 30 minutes, then stir and mash with the back of a spoon to break up the berries. When ready to serve, stir in the remaining 1/2 cup fresh blackberries.
9. Meanwhile, pour heavy cream into the chilled bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on high until soft peaks form. Turn speed to low and gently whisk in sour cream, salt, and sugar. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
10. To serve, slice each rectangle in half horizontally. Top the bottom half with a spoonful (about 3 tablespoons) of blackberries and their sauce, and then garnish with a generous dollop of whipped cream and place the top half of the cake on top. Repeat to form remaining servings.

"Using a candy thermometer during the peanut brittle preparation is crucial for ensuring that the candy reaches the right temperature of 295°F, which is the optimal point for achieving the desired texture and crunchiness of the brittle. Cooking to this exact temperature allows the sugars to caramelize properly, resulting in a crispy and delicious candy.

### Ingredients
* 8 medium bananas
* 1 cup salted dry-roasted peanuts
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup light corn syrup
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter plus more for baking sheet
* 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
* 12 ounces bittersweet (60% cacao) chocolate, chopped
* 8 wooden popsicle sticks
* **Candy thermometer**

### Instructions
1. Line a large baking sheet with wax paper.
2. Peel bananas and carefully insert a popsicle stick into the bottom end of each banana, halfway up the stick. Arrange bananas on the baking sheet and freeze until firm but not frozen hard, about 1 hour. (You don't want the bananas so cold that the chocolate solidifies before you add the peanut brittle.)
3. Butter a rimmed baking sheet. Combine peanuts, sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a heavy saucepan, and bring slowly to a boil over medium heat, stirring.
4. Position a candy thermometer so that it can rest on the side of the pan with the bulb in the mixture. Slowly boil, without stirring but tilting and swirling the mixture in the pan if it begins to color unevenly. Cook until deep golden and the temperature reaches 295°F on the thermometer, about 5 minutes.
5. Remove the pan from heat and stir in butter and baking soda (the mixture will foam up). Immediately pour the molten candy onto the baking sheet. Let it cool completely, 45 minutes to 1 hour, then pry from the baking sheet and finely chop.
6. Melt chocolate in a deep metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove the bowl of chocolate from the pan. Working with 1 banana at a time, set the banana in the bowl and coat most of the banana evenly in chocolate by spooning it on and smoothing it with the back of the spoon.
7. Immediately sprinkle peanut brittle over the chocolate coating while the chocolate is still wet, then return the coated banana to the wax paper-lined sheet, and let it set while coating the remaining bananas. Refreeze bananas if necessary to firm up chocolate.

* 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
* 1 1/4 cups warm milk
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for brushing
* 3 large egg yolks
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
* 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

### Instructions:
1. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm milk. Sprinkle with a pinch of the sugar and let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Turn the mixer on low speed and add the remaining 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup of the sugar, the 1 cup melted butter, the egg yolks, and salt. Add 2 cups of the flour and turn the speed up to medium; continue to mix until incorporated.

4. Combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon in a small bowl. Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with melted butter.
5. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a rectangle about the size of the loaf pan. Brush the surface of the dough with melted butter and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly across. Roll the dough up, jelly-roll style, into a long cylinder, and pinch the seam closed. Put the dough in the prepared loaf pan, seam side down. Make sure the dough touches all sides of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise a second time, until the top of the dough is nearly level with the top of the loaf pan, about 20 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Brush the dough with more melted butter.

"When it comes to using fresh mint versus thyme in dishes, each herb imparts very different flavors and qualities. 

### Variations:
- **Fresh Mint**: Mint brings a bright, refreshing, and slightly sweet flavor, making it ideal for fruit dishes, salads, and relishes, where a burst of freshness is desirable. It works particularly well in dishes like the **Pomegranate-Mint Relish**, where its sweetness complements the tartness of the pomegranate.
  
- **Thyme**: In contrast, thyme has a more earthy, savory taste that can add depth and complexity to savory dishes like soups and meat preparations. It is typically used in compositions where a herbaceous undertone is more appropriate, and it does not provide the same refreshing lift as mint.

If you are considering a recipe that features either herb, you might want to evaluate the overall flavor profile you aim to achieve.

"To prepare the corn tortillas before adding cheese, follow these steps:

### Ingredients
- 2 cups corn masa mix (see Note)
- 1 1/2 cups warm water

### Instructions
1. Combine the masa mix and warm water in a medium bowl, mixing until a soft dough forms. You can use a wooden spoon for mixing, but you will have better results if you use your hands. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until it is smooth.
2. If the dough seems dry, add more water, a tablespoon at a time, as necessary.
3. To form the tortillas, one at a time, pinch off small handfuls (about 3 tablespoons) of the dough and roll each one between the palms of your hands into a ball. Cover the dough balls with a damp cloth as you form them, to keep them from drying out.
4. Cut a quart-size resealable plastic bag open down both sides, to form a rectangle. Use the bag to line a tortilla press as you shape the tortillas, so they do not stick: Lay one side of the plastic over the bottom of the press, place a ball of dough in the center, and fold the other side of the plastic over the dough. Shut the top of the tortilla press firmly down on the dough to shape the tortilla.
5. Heat a griddle until hot. Place a tortilla on the griddle and cook for 1 1/2 minutes.

"When cooked properly, fish should reach an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). 

Here’s a delicious recipe for **Grilled Fish** that you might enjoy!

### Ingredients:
- 1 teaspoon finely minced garlic, about 3 cloves
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, orange juice, or dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar or sherry vinegar
- a pinch of cayenne pepper or hot red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, or 1 teaspoon or more chopped fresh herbs such as rosemary, dill, parsley, thyme, cilantro, basil, or mint, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme or oregano, crumbled
- freshly ground black pepper
- 2 pounds fish steaks
- lemon wedges for garnish

### Instructions:
1. Combine all the ingredients except fish and lemon wedges and mix well. Using a pastry brush, paint the fish steaks liberally on both sides and set them aside, lightly covered with a piece of aluminum foil, to marinate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Build up a fire, using good hardwoods if you're cooking in a fireplace or the best hardwood charcoal (not fake-wood briquettes) if you're using a grill. Let the fire burn brightly and die down until you have a nice bed of hot coals or embers. Large pieces of fish can be set directly on the grill, but to prevent smaller ones from falling through and burning up, you may want to use a special grid made for fish.
3. When you're ready to cook, brush a little plain olive oil on the cooking surface and set it 4 to 6 inches from the source of heat. Arrange the fish steaks so that they have equal access to the heat source. Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side, turning once. Test for doneness—fish should be opaque all the way through—by inserting the tip of a sharp knife near the bone or in the center of a boneless piece of fish. Remove immediately to a hot platter.
4. The remaining marinade should be heated just to the boiling point and either poured over the cooked fish or passed at the table along with lemon wedges.

"To achieve the best results when simmering stuffed vegetables in the sauce, you should simmer for about **45 minutes**. This time allows the flavors to develop and the sauce to reduce properly, ensuring your stuffed vegetables are beautifully infused with taste.

### Ingredients
- 2 pounds ripe tomatoes, or 3 cups canned whole peeled tomatoes with their juice
- 1 medium sweet yellow onion
- 5 tablespoons butter

"Toasting the dried ancho and guajillo chiles for the Pulled Brisket Sliders is essential for enhancing their flavor. When the chiles are toasted, they become slightly puffed and aromatic, which unlocks their rich, complex flavors and adds depth to the final dish. This step is important as it sets the foundation for the chile-tomato purée that will be used to braise the brisket, ensuring a more savory and aromatic outcome.

### Ingredients:
- 3 dried ancho chiles
- 3 dried guajillo chiles
- 3 medium tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds total)
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 4 pounds beef brisket, cut into 3-inch pieces, or boneless short ribs
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 24 mini buns or dinner rolls, split

### Instructions:
1. With a stovetop burner set to high, use tongs to hold each chile about 3 inches from the flame and toast until slightly puffed and aromatic, about 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining chiles, transferring them to a large bowl as toasted. Cover the chiles with about 1 quart boiling water. (If the chiles float, puncture each with a small knife to let the water inside.) Steep the chiles until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes. Drain and let cool. Once the chiles are cool enough to handle, remove the stems and most of the seeds and transfer to a blender or the bowl of a food processor.
2. While the chiles are soaking, arrange a rack about 6 inches from the flame and preheat the broiler. Arrange the tomatoes on the broiler pan or a baking sheet and broil, flipping several times to expose all sides, until the entire surface is charred, 5 to 6 minutes. Let the tomatoes cool slightly then remove and discard the charred skin. Add the tomato flesh to the chiles in the blender or food processor. Add the garlic, oregano, cumin, cloves, and 1 cup water and process until smooth.
3. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 300°F. Cut a piece of parchment into a round the same size as a large Dutch oven.
4. Season the meat with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over moderate heat, heat the oil until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, sear the meat until brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. As browned, transfer the meat to a plate.
5. Once all of the meat is seared, return it all to the pot and add the reserved chile-tomato purée. Bring to a boil and then place the parchment round over the meat. Cover the pot with a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is very tender and falling apart, about 3 hours. Discard the parchment then transfer the meat to a cutting board and use two forks to shred it into small pieces, discarding any excess fat. Skim any excess fat from the braising liquid then return the meat to the pot and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.

"The purpose of lifting the cooked egg around the edges while cooking the frittata is to allow the uncooked egg to flow underneath and around the sides. This technique helps ensure that the frittata cooks evenly and that the center sets properly without overcooking the edges.

Here’s a simple frittata recipe that demonstrates this technique:

### Use-It-Up Frittata

#### Ingredients:
- 6 large eggs, beaten to blend
- 1 1/2 cups (1/2-inch pieces) cooked vegetables
- 1/2 cup cooked grains or shelled peas or beans
- 1 ounce coarsely grated or crumbled cheese
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped tender herbs
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided

1. Fold eggs, vegetables, grains, cheese, and herbs in a medium bowl with a rubber spatula; season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium. Cook egg mixture until edges are set, about 30 seconds. Use spatula to agitate eggs by scraping bottom of skillet in a small circular motion and bringing edges toward center of pan to form large curds, then let mixture sit undisturbed until edges are set again, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, tilting skillet and lifting edges up with spatula to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath and around sides, until surface is wet but center is mostly set when you shake the pan, about 5 minutes.
2. Place a large plate over skillet and invert frittata onto plate. Place skillet back over medium heat and add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Slide frittata back into skillet; reduce heat to low. Cook until set, about 3 minutes. Let frittata cool in skillet for 5 minutes. Invert frittata onto a cutting board; season with salt and pepper. Cut into wedges.

"If you don't have fresh ginger for the marinade, you can substitute it with ground ginger. Use about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground ginger for every tablespoon of fresh ginger required in the recipe. However, keep in mind that fresh ginger has a different flavor profile and a more vibrant taste.

Here's a suggested recipe using ginger:

### Squid with Ginger-Soy Sauce Marinade

#### Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger (or substitute with ground ginger)
* 3 tablespoons mirin
* 1 pound small squid (bodies and tentacles), cleaned

#### Instructions:
1. Mix together the soy sauce, ginger, and mirin in a large bowl to make the marinade. Reserve 1/2 cup of the marinade and set aside. Lay the squid in the remaining liquid, gently turning 4 times to coat all over. Marinate the squid for 10 minutes at room temperature, turning once.
  
2. Preheat a grill to hot. Grill the squid for about 4 minutes (5 minutes if they're larger than 1 ounce apiece). Every 30 seconds flip the squid and brush on the reserved marinade. The squid will turn from translucent to white when they're ready, becoming tender and releasing a rich aroma. Be careful not to overcook; squid turns rubbery if grilled too long. Serve immediately.

"Yes, you can use a different type of mushroom instead of white mushrooms in recipes. Many types of mushrooms, such as cremini or portabella, can be great substitutes and will provide unique flavors to your dishes. 

Here is a recipe for **Mushroom Sauté** which uses white mushrooms, but you can easily adapt it with other mushroom types:

### Ingredients:
* 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
* 1 1/2 pounds tightly closed firm white mushrooms (or other mushrooms, such as cremini)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 6 (1/2-inch-thick) slices firm white sandwich bread, crusts discarded and slices halved diagonally
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley

### Instructions:
1. Soak mushrooms in bowl of water and some lemon juice for 5 minutes. Hold paring knife by back of blade, not handle. Orient the knifepoint to center of mushroom cap. Pivot blade into cap on bias. Rock mushroom toward you and knife away from you in a smooth, easy motion, beveling out a strip. Repeat with remaining mushrooms.
   
2. Preheat broiler.

3.

"Yes, you can use a different type of sweetener instead of agave nectar in the cookie dough. In the recipe for **Honey-Vanilla Sablé Cookie Dough**, honey is used as a sweetener alongside granulated sugar. You might consider using alternative liquid sweeteners like maple syrup or another syrup that has a similar consistency and sweetness level to agave nectar.

Here’s the recipe for your reference:

### Honey-Vanilla Sablé Cookie Dough

#### Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 vanilla beans, split lengthwise
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, room temperature
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1/4 cup honey

#### Instructions
1. Whisk flour, cardamom, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Place sugar in a large bowl and scrape in vanilla seeds; save pods for another use. Massage mixture with your fingers until sugar looks like wet sand. Add butter and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until mixture is smooth. Add egg yolk and honey; beat to combine. Reduce speed to low; add dry ingredients in 2 additions, mixing well after each addition. Knead dough a couple of times to incorporate any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl.
   
2. Divide dough in half and pat into two 9”-long logs. Wrap each log in parchment paper, then wrap tightly in plastic. Roll each log across work surface to make as round and regular as possible, then chill until firm, about 2 hours.
   
3. Preheat oven to 350°F. Gently scatter half of sanding sugar over a small portion of work surface. Unwrap 1 log of dough and roll log in sugar, applying a bit of pressure to help it stick, until evenly coated. Slice dough into 1/4""–1/2""-thick rounds, rolling log every few slices to avoid creating a flat surface. Place cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing about 2"" apart and chill. Scatter remaining sanding sugar on surface and repeat with remaining log of dough.
   
4. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until cookies are golden around the edges but still pale in the center, 13–18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.
   
5. Dough can be made 1 month ahead; freeze instead of chilling. Thaw in refrigerator overnight before using. Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.

"The purpose of boiling the walnuts in the Sweet Walnuts preparation is to blanch them, which helps in removing any bitterness and also makes them more susceptible to absorbing the sugar syrup in the later steps of the recipe. This process improves the overall texture and flavor of the finished product.

Here are the ingredients and instructions for Sweet Walnuts:

### Ingredients
- 10 cups water; plus 6 tablespoons for glaze
- 12 ounces (about 4 cups) walnut halves
- 6 tablespoons sugar
- 5 cups peanut oil

### Instructions
1. Place 5 cups of the water in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the walnuts and stir. Allow the water to return to a boil and boil for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and run cold water into the pot. Drain the nuts thoroughly in a strainer. Return the nuts to the pot, add 5 cups of the water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow the nuts to boil for 5 minutes, then drain again and set the walnuts aside to dry.

2. This next step requires a wok that is completely free of oil. Place the 6 tablespoons water in the wok and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve with a spatula. Bring to boil and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Add the walnuts and continue to stir for about 8 minutes, or until the nuts are coated completely with the sugar syrup and the liquid in the wok has evaporated. As the walnuts become glazed with the syrup, take care to regulate the heat so neither the nuts nor the glaze burns.

3. Turn off the heat. Using a Chinese strainer, remove the walnuts and set aside on a plate. Wash the wok and the spatula with extremely hot water to remove the sugar residue and dry thoroughly.

4. Place the peanut oil in the wok, and heat it to 375ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Place the walnuts on the strainer and lower them into the hot oil. Fry the walnuts, stirring with the spatula, for about 5 minutes, or until they turn a golden amber brown. Turn off the heat. Scoop the nuts from the oil with the strainer and allow to drain briefly.

5. Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and let cool completely. After 2 minutes, loosen the walnuts so they do not stick to one another. Serve the cooled nuts or transfer them to an airtight container and store as directed in the introduction.

"To keep the stuffing from being too wet when mixing it, you can follow these tips based on the **If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It Stuffing** recipe:

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more
- 1 1/2 pound loaf sourdough bread, sliced 1"" thick, torn into 1/2""–3/4"" pieces
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound breakfast sausage, casings removed if needed
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 fennel bulb, finely chopped
- 4 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal or 1 1/4 tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
- 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped sage
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme
- 3 large eggs
- 4 cups Thanksgiving Stock or low-sodium chicken broth, divided

### Instructions:
1. Place racks in middle and top of oven; preheat to 300°F. Butter a 3-qt. baking dish. Divide bread between 2 rimmed baking sheets and bake on middle rack, tossing occasionally, until dried out (do not let brown more than just a bit around the edges), 25–35 minutes. Let cool.
2. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Arrange sausage in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 3 minutes. Break up into bite-size pieces with 2 spatulas or spoons and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer sausage to a plate.
3. Reduce heat to medium and melt 1 cup butter in the same skillet. Add onion, fennel, and celery; season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender but not browned, 12–15 minutes. Add wine and scrape the bottom of the skillet to release any browned bits. Bring to a boil and cook until wine is evaporated, about 3 minutes. Toss in parsley, sage, and thyme and let mixture cool in the skillet.
4. Increase oven temperature to 350°F. Whisk eggs and 2 cups stock in a very large bowl. Add bread, sausage, and onion mixture and toss well to combine. Add 2 tsp. or 1 1/4 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper. Drizzle remaining 2 cups stock over and toss again to combine. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until bread absorbs all of the liquid, about 10 minutes.
5. Transfer stuffing to prepared dish; butter a sheet of foil and cover the dish, butter side down. Bake on the middle rack until very hot throughout (it should feel too hot to comfortably touch in the center; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should register 160°F), 35–40 minutes.
6. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. Remove foil and transfer the baking dish to the top rack. Continue to bake stuffing until golden brown, 25–30 minutes longer.
7. Stuffing can be assembled 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.

By ensuring that your bread is well-dried out before mixing and allowing it to absorb the stock gradually, you can maintain a good texture and prevent the stuffing from becoming overly wet.

"To achieve a crispy texture for the rice, it should be cooked undisturbed until it begins to crisp, which takes about **2 minutes** for the initial crisping and then pressing down and cooking again for another **about 2 minutes**. Therefore, you'll want to cook the rice for around **4 minutes** in total to achieve that crispy texture.

### Ingredients:
- 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1/3 cup grapeseed or vegetable oil
- Kosher salt
- 1 (2"") piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped
- 1 large egg, beaten to blend
- 3 cups chilled cooked short-grain rice
- 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal
- 3/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro
- 2 tsp. toasted sesame seeds

### Instructions:
1. Toss garlic and grapeseed oil in a large nonstick skillet. Arrange garlic in a single layer and set over medium heat. Cook, shaking pan often, until garlic is barely golden and crisp (oil should stop bubbling at this point), about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic chips to paper towels to drain; season with salt.
2. Increase heat to medium-high and cook ginger in oil in the same skillet, stirring occasionally, until just softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add egg and stir to break up; cook until just set (this will take a matter of seconds). Add rice and sesame oil and toss to combine. Cook, undisturbed, pressing down on rice with a spatula so it makes good contact with the pan, until rice begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Give rice a toss, then press down on it again, cooking until you get more crispy bits, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and toss in scallions and half of garlic chips; season with salt.
3. Transfer fried rice to a platter and scatter cilantro, sesame seeds, and remaining garlic chips on top.
4. Garlic chips can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

"The spiced caramel sauce recipe does not specify any spices included in its ingredients. The provided recipes focus on the core components needed for making various caramel sauces, such as sugar, cream, and butter, but do not mention specific spices. 

Here are the details regarding the caramel sauce:

### Caramel Sauce
**Ingredients:**
* Medium saucepan
* Pastry brush
* Wooden spoon or heat-proof rubber spatula
* Oven mitts
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 cup heavy cream

**Instructions:**
1. In the medium saucepan, whisk the sugar with the water so there are no sugar clumps. Cook over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved and the water looks clear, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat up to medium-high and brush down the side of the saucepan with the pastry brush dipped in water. (This prevents any sugar from sticking to the side of the pan and forming crystals.) Have the cream in a measuring cup with a spout right near your stovetop where you can reach it.
2. With the heat still at medium-high, continue to cook. Do not stir the caramel anymore at this point. After about 15 minutes, you'll notice the bubbles getting bigger and slower just before the caramel begins to turn color.
3. As soon as the caramel turns a medium tan color, remove the pan from the heat. The bubbles will subside a little, so it will be easier for you to check the color. Watch carefully and as soon as it turns a dark tan, slowly pour in a couple of tablespoons of the cream. Stand back a little and be careful - the cream will cause the hot caramel to bubble up. Stir the cream into the caramel with the heat-proof spatula. Once the caramel stops sputtering, stir in more cream. Continue to pour in the remaining cream but stop again at any time if it sputters.
4. Let the caramel sauce cool to room temperature. Refrigerate in a covered container for up to 3 weeks. If there is any hard caramel sticking to the pan, fill it with water and bring it to a boil. Allow to cool before cleaning the pan.

"For the **Breakfast Hobo Packs**, you should use **cooked breakfast sausages**. Specifically, the recipe calls for **12 ounces of cooked breakfast sausages** (about 16 sausage links), cut into **3/4"" pieces** before being tossed with the other ingredients.

Here are the ingredients and instructions for making the Breakfast Hobo Packs:

### Ingredients
- 3 scallions, trimmed, sliced
- 1 (16-ounce) package frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, defrosted
- 12 ounces cooked breakfast sausages (about 16 sausage links), cut into 3/4"" pieces
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- 3 (packed) cups baby spinach
- 6 large eggs
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar (optional)

### Instructions
1. Cut 12 (12x16"") pieces of heavy-duty foil. Layer 2 pieces of foil on top of each other to create 6 stacks. Line top pieces of foil with parchment paper cut to the same size.
2. Toss scallions, potatoes, sausage, oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Divide mixture among prepared packs, arranging in the center of each piece of parchment. Bring edges of foil together to enclose each pack, covering completely, then crimp to seal packs closed.
3. Prepare a campfire or grill for medium, indirect heat, preferably with hardwood or hardwood charcoal. Let coals burn until covered with ash and glowing red with no black remaining.
4. Place packs side by side directly onto hot coals or grill and cook, rotating with tongs occasionally, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove 1 pack from heat and check if ingredients are steaming hot. If necessary, return pack to coals and continue to cook, 5–10 minutes more.
5. Transfer packs with tongs to a flat surface and carefully open them (they will be full of hot steam). Top each pack with spinach, then crack 1 egg into the center of each and season with salt and pepper. Reseal, return to coals, and cook until egg whites are opaque but yolks are still runny, 4–5 minutes.
6. Carefully remove packs from coals, open, and sprinkle with cheddar, if using. Serve immediately.
7. Packs can be assembled and chilled for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month.

"To make **Food Processor Butter**, you should use **2 cups of heavy cream**, preferably not ultra-pasteurized. The level of pasteurization is important because unpasteurized cream will separate faster, yielding butter more quickly when processed.

Here is the recipe:

### Ingredients
- 2 cups heavy cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized
- 1 tsp. kosher salt (optional)
- 2 Tbsp. sugar
- 1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp. finely grated orange zest
- 1/4 cup parsley leaves with tender stems, finely chopped
- 1 tsp. finely grated garlic
- 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest
- 2 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds
- 2 tsp. coarsely grated black pepper
- 2 tsp. smoked paprika
- Cheesecloth

### Instructions
1.  Process cream in a food processor until the butter solids have separated from the buttermilk and you see lots of little clumps of butter clinging together distinctly separated from thin milky liquid, 4–7 minutes (unpasteurized cream will separate more quickly).

### Ingredients
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
* 8 large eggs
* 1 3/4 cups sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon thyme leaves
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided

"Stirring in cornmeal is not specifically mentioned in the recipes provided, particularly not in the ""Cream of Tomato Soup with Souffléed Cheese Toasts."" However, in general cooking practices, when cornmeal is stirred into a liquid (like soup), it helps to thicken the mixture and creates a creamy texture.

In soups, stirring in cornmeal allows it to absorb liquid, swell, and release starches, which can lead to a smoother and more cohesive texture, enhancing the overall experience of the dish.

Here’s a visual from ""Cream of Tomato Soup with Souffléed Cheese Toasts"":

![Cream of Tomato Soup with Souffléed Cheese Toasts](../data/Food_Images/cream-of-tomato-soup-with-souffleed-cheese-toasts-355878.jpg)

Let cool briefly, then puree in a blender until smooth.
2. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Return the soup to the pot, add the milk, and season with salt. If the soup is too thick, thin it with additional milk or stock. If the tomato flavor isn't as rich as you'd like (if the tomatoes were packed in water instead of puree), deepen it by stirring in a little tomato paste.
3. For the toasts, combine the yolk, if you're using it, with the mustard and cayenne, then stir in the cheese. Whisk the white until it holds soft peaks and fold it into the mixture along with the scallion.

"To create a bloodshot appearance in frosting, you might want to tint the remaining frosting a bright red or deep burgundy. This will enhance the effect when swirled or dripped, resembling bloodshot eyes.

Unfortunately, specific instructions on tinting frosting for this purpose isn't provided in the context, but using red food coloring should achieve the desired outcome.

Here’s a related recipe for **Creamy Vanilla Frosting**, in case you would like to use a fresh batch:

### Ingredients:
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk
- 2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

### Instructions:
1. In a medium-size saucepan, whisk the flour into the milk until smooth. Place over medium heat and, stirring constantly, cook until the mixture becomes very thick and begins to bubble, 10-15 minutes. Cover with waxed paper placed directly on the surface and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, on the medium high speed of an electric mixer, beat the butter for 3 minutes, until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, beating continuously for 3 minutes until fluffy. Add the vanilla and beat well.
3. Add the cooled milk mixture, and continue to beat on the medium high speed for 5 minutes, until very smooth and noticeably whiter in color. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes (no less and no longer—set a timer!). Use immediately.

2. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the sweet potatoes on the sheet and roast them for about 45 minutes, or until they’re quite soft and a knife easily pierces through the flesh. Remove them from the oven, slice them open, and allow them to cool for a few minutes.
3. About 30 minutes into the roasting of the sweet potatoes, start baking the bacon. Once the bacon is cool, roughly chop it, then set it aside.
4. To make the sweet potato purée, I find it easiest to cut the ends off the sweet potatoes, then peel the skin off. Place the roasted flesh into a food processor, then add the coconut milk, vanilla, salt, and, if desired, collagen powder. Purée for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture is smooth. If it’s too thick, add a splash more of the coconut milk and process again. If you don’t have a food processor, combine everything in a large bowl and stir it very well with a wooden spoon.
5. Divide the sweet potato purée between serving bowls. Top it with the chopped bacon, blueberries, sliced banana, and chopped almonds, and serve.
6. The bowls can be assembled ahead of time, but it’s best to leave the fruit off until they’re ready to eat. They can be eaten cold or gently reheated.

"Reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water is important because it helps to adjust the consistency of the sauce once the pasta is combined with the ingredients.

"Letting the ice cream sit for 5 minutes before mixing it with other ingredients is important for allowing the mixture to cool just slightly, making it easier to incorporate other ingredients without cooking them. This step ensures a smoother texture in the final product.

### Ingredients for The Dude Ice Cream:
* 2 cups whole milk
* 3/4 cup coarsely ground coffee beans
* 3/4 cup organic cane sugar
* 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons skim milk powder
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 3 egg yolks
* 1/4 cup vodka

### Instructions:
1. Prepare an ice bath in the sink or in a large heatproof bowl.
2. In a large saucepan, heat the milk over medium-high heat until it starts to steam, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the coffee. Cover the pan and let the coffee steep for 10 minutes. Pour the mixture through a cheesecloth-lined wire-mesh strainer into a bowl. Return the coffee-infused milk to the saucepan.
3. Add the sugar and skim milk powder. Stir with a hand mixer or whisk until smooth. Make sure the skim milk powder is wholly dissolved and that no lumps remain. Stir in the cream.
4. Clip a candy thermometer to the saucepan and set the pan over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the mixture reaches 110°F, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
5. Place the egg yolks in a medium bowl. While whisking, slowly pour 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks to temper them. Continue to whisk until the mixture is even in color and consistency, then whisk the egg-yolk mixture back into the remaining milk mixture.
6. Return the pan to the stovetop over medium heat and continue cooking until it reaches 165°F, 5 to 10 minutes more. Add the vodka and stir to combine.
7. Transfer the pan to the prepared ice bath and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour the ice cream base through a wire-mesh strainer into a storage container and place in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours, or until completely cool.
8. Transfer the cooled base to an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.
9. Transfer the ice cream to a storage container. Serve immediately or harden in your freezer for 8 to 12 hours for a more scoopable ice cream.

"Letting the turkey sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting is essential as it helps the turkey cook more quickly and evenly. This allows the meat to reach the desired internal temperature without resulting in uneven cooking, which can happen if the turkey is too cold when placed in the oven.

Here’s a recipe with this important step:

### Turkey for Two with Pan-Sauce Gravy

#### Ingredients:
- 1 split skin-on, bone-in turkey breast (about 2 lb.)
- 2 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
- 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- 2/3 cup dry white wine
- 2 sprigs thyme
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 1 sprig sage
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tsp. cornstarch
- 1 Tbsp. cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

#### Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Season turkey with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, which will help the turkey cook more quickly and evenly.
2. Heat oil in a 10"" ovenproof skillet over high until just barely smoking. Sear turkey skin side down until deeply golden brown, about 5 minutes; transfer to a plate. Add wine to skillet, scraping up browned bits with a spatula, and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, add thyme, rosemary, sage, garlic, cornstarch, and 2/3 cup water, and whisk to combine.
3. Place breast skin side up in liquid in skillet and transfer skillet to oven. Roast, checking every 20 minutes or so and adding 1/4 cup more water if liquid under turkey is evaporating lower than 1"" in pan, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast without touching bone registers 150°F, about 50 minutes (temperature will continue to rise as turkey rests).
4. Transfer turkey to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.
5. Meanwhile, remove herb sprigs from skillet and discard. Whisk liquid remaining in skillet until garlic mostly dissolves, adding a splash of water and heating over high if needed to loosen (gravy should be thick but easily pourable). Whisk butter into gravy until melted. Strain gravy through a fine-mesh sieve into a small pitcher or bowl.
6. Serve turkey with gravy alongside.

"The purpose of the rock salt when preparing the oysters in the recipe for **Roasted Oysters with Pickled Radishes, Carrots and Celery Root** is to provide a stable base that keeps the oysters from tipping over. This ensures that the oyster stays upright, preventing the juices from spilling out while they are being baked.

### Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup minced leek (white part)
- 1 shallot, minced
- 1 garlic clove, minced

"The type of oil used to cook the ingredients at the beginning of this recipe is **olive oil**.

### Rosemary Olive Oil Bread

#### Ingredients:
- 3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, plus more as needed
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 2 teaspoons coarse kosher or sea salt
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves

#### Instructions:
1. Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor. Turn on the machine and add the olive oil through the feed tube, followed by 3/4 cup water. Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch.
2. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and, by hand, knead in the rosemary until the dough feels smooth. Put it in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until the dough doubles in size, about 2 hours. (You can cut this rising time as short as 1 hour if you are in a hurry, or you can let the dough rise more slowly, in the refrigerator, for up to 8 hours. At this point, you may also wrap the dough tightly in plastic and freeze for up to a month; defrost in a covered bowl in the refrigerator or at room temperature.)
3. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Shape the dough into a boule, sprinkling with flour as necessary but keeping it to a minimum. Line a colander or large bowl with a well-floured kitchen towel, set the loaf in the bowl, and cover with another towel (this keeps it from spreading too much). Let the dough rise for at least an hour and preferably longer, up to 2 hours.
4. About 45 minutes before the dough has risen, heat the oven to 425°F. Put an ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) on the floor or the lowest rack while the oven heats. If you’re using a baking stone, put it on the rack above the skillet while the oven heats; if not, line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Once you’re ready to bake, slide or turn the dough out onto a lightly floured peel or flexible cutting board, seam side down, or just transfer it to the prepared baking sheet. Rub the loaf with a little flour (this helps prevent scorching) and slash the top with a sharp knife or razor blade. Use the peel or cutting board to slide the loaf onto the baking stone or slide the baking sheet into the oven. Partially pull out the rack with the heated skillet and very carefully pour 1 cup hot water into the skillet (it will create a lot of steam). Slide the rack back in and immediately close the oven door.
6. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, turning the bread or the baking sheet halfway through, until the crust is golden brown, the bottom sounds hollow when tapped, and the internal temperature reaches 200°F on a quick-read thermometer. If the bread is browning too quickly, lower the temperature to 400°F. Remove and cool on a wire rack.
7. Rosemary Olive Oil Bread With Olives or Tomatoes: In Step 2, knead 1 cup halved pitted oil-cured olives, roughly chopped dried tomatoes, or a combination into the dough along with the rosemary.
8. Olive Oil Bread With Onions and Mint: A nice combo; you can make this with olives too (see the preceding variation), but omit the rosemary. In Step 2, knead 1 large onion, chopped, into the dough in place of or along with the olives. Add 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint if you like.
9. Pancetta and Black Pepper Bread: Rich, savory, and packed with flavor: You can use olive oil here if you’d rather not use the pancetta pan drippings: Omit the rosemary. Chop 1 pound pancetta (or bacon) and cook until it’s crisp. Drain the meat and set it aside, reserving 1/3 cup of the rendered fat. If you don’t have enough, add olive oil or good-quality lard to make up the balance. Proceed with the recipe, using the reserved fat in place of the oil. In Step 2, knead in the pancetta pieces and 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper.

"To make the dumplings, you will need **2 tablespoons of vegetable oil** for frying. The oil should be heated over medium-low heat until it reaches a temperature where a few drops of water added to the pan sizzle and evaporate.

Here are the details:

### Ingredients:
- 3 ounces spinach (ideally Chinese water spinach; about 2 cups packed)
- 8 large eggs
- 2½ tablespoons skim milk
- 1½ teaspoons kosher salt
- **2 tablespoons vegetable oil**
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 24 Boiled Dumpling Wrappers

### Instructions:
1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the spinach and cook for 30 seconds, until it turns a vivid green, then, using a slotted spoon, transfer it to a bowl of ice water. Chill thoroughly and drain. Wrap the spinach in a clean cheesecloth or tea towel to wring out excess moisture, then roughly chop it and set it aside.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and ¼ teaspoon of the salt and set aside. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-low heat until a few drops of water added to the pan sizzle and evaporate. Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes, just until the eggs form fluffy curds but have not fully set; they should still be slightly runny. Remove from the heat and let cool in a medium bowl.
3. Use your hands to gently fold the eggs, sesame oil, oyster sauce, remaining 1¼ teaspoons of salt, and pepper together until fully combined. Gently fold in the spinach and mix until fully incorporated.
4. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Holding a wrapper in your palm, use a fork to add about 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of the wrapper, then lightly pat down the filling with the fork to get rid of any air bubbles.
5. Fold the dumpling into the round yuan bao shape: Cradle the wrapper in your hands and fold the edge closest to you over the filling. Lightly squeeze the dumpling to push out any air bubbles. Clasp one end of the dumpling between your thumb and index finger to pinch it shut; repeat on the other side of the dumpling. Cradle the dumpling in your palms, clasping the sealed edge between your thumbs and index fingers, and squeeze it shut while pushing inward, making sure to squeeze out any air bubbles. The dumpling's belly should form a teardrop shape between your thumbs, which will create the yuan bao shape. Inspect the dumpling for any fissures that could rupture during cooking and pinch them shut. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers.
6. Working in batches, add the dumplings to the pot, 6 at a time. Boil for 2 minutes on high, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 1 minute, then reduce the heat again to medium and cook for 2 more minutes. The dumplings are ready a minute or so after they rise to the surface; their skins will turn puffy. Using a slotted spoon, gently transfer the dumplings to a plate and serve immediately.

"Yes, you can use a different flavor extract instead of almond extract in the recipe for Pistachio Blancmanges. While almond extract is specified in the ingredients, other extracts could provide a unique flavor profile, such as vanilla extract or even hazelnut extract. Just keep in mind that the taste will differ from the original recipe.

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups shelled unsalted pistachios (not dyed red; 7 oz)
- 1 3/4 cups whole milk
- 1/8 teaspoon almond extract (can be substituted)
- 1 3/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (from a 1/4-oz envelope)
- 2 tablespoons cold water
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 cup chilled heavy cream
- Accompaniment: brandied poached peaches
- Garnish: chopped unsalted pistachios
- 8 (4-oz) oval or round metal molds or ceramic ramekins; a thin fine-weave kitchen towel (not terry cloth)

### Instructions
1. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 350°F. Oil molds and line bottom of each with an oval of wax paper.
2. Spread pistachios on a baking sheet and toast until nuts are fragrant but not colored, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool completely. Rub off and discard any skins.
3. Blend nuts with milk in a blender or food processor 2 minutes. Rinse kitchen towel under cold water and wring out as much water as possible. Line a large sieve with towel, then set sieve over a bowl or large glass measure and pour pistachio mixture into towel. Wrap towel up and around mixture and, working over sieve, squeeze pistachio milk (about 1 cup) from towel into bowl, discarding ground pistachios. Stir in almond extract (or substitute) and a pinch of salt.
4. Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in a very small bowl or a cup and let stand 1 minute.
5. Heat pistachio milk and sugar in a small saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Add gelatin mixture and cook, stirring, until gelatin is dissolved. Transfer to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring constantly, just until mixture is the consistency of raw egg white. Remove bowl from ice water.
6. Beat cream in another bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks, then whisk one fourth of cream into pistachio mixture to lighten. Fold in remaining cream gently but thoroughly and spoon mixture into molds. Chill blancmanges, covered with plastic wrap, until set, at least 6 hours.
7. Working with 1 blancmange at a time, run tip of a thin knife between each custard and metal mold. Tilt mold sideways and tap side of mold against a work surface, turning it, to evenly break seal and loosen custard. Keeping mold tilted, invert a dessert plate over mold, then invert blancmange onto plate.

Here are the ingredients and instructions for Vanilla Extract, which showcases how to use it:

### Vanilla Extract

**Ingredients:**
- Cheap vodka, enough to fill your jar or bottle
- Spent vanilla beans (at least 3)

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a mason jar or bottle with vodka. After you use the seeds of a vanilla bean in a recipe, rinse off the vanilla bean and put it in the vodka. You'll need at least 3 vanilla beans in there for at least 3 weeks to get a good extract going, but it's fine to use more beans, too. Your extract is ready when it is a lovely brown color and it smells like vanilla.
2. Either pour the extract into a new bottle and start over or keep topping off the working bottle with vodka and keep shoving more vanilla beans into the bottle. As long as you don't let it get too empty, you can keep using the extract indefinitely even as you continue to top it off.

- 2 celery stalks, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 tablespoons black peppercorns
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar

* 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
* 4 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 lemons, halved
* 1 1/2 tsp. honey
* 1/2 tsp. Aleppo-style pepper
* 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil

### Instructions:
1. Pat chicken thighs dry and season well with salt and black pepper. Place in a large resealable plastic bag and add vinegar. Seal bag and gently massage chicken to ensure all thighs are coated in vinegar. Chill 1 hour.
2. Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove chicken thighs from bag and pat dry with paper towels. The drier the skin, the crispier it will be when cooked.
3. Place chicken thighs, skin side down, in a dry large cast-iron skillet and set over medium heat. Cook undisturbed until they easily release from the pan, about 4 minutes. Continue to cook, moving chicken around occasionally to ensure the skin is cooking evenly, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Add garlic and transfer skillet to oven. Bake until chicken is cooked through, 10–12 minutes. Transfer chicken and garlic to a plate.
4. Set skillet over medium-high heat and cook lemons, cut side down, until edges are deeply charred (they should be almost black), about 5 minutes. Transfer to plate with chicken and garlic and let cool slightly.
5. Squeeze lemon juice into a small bowl; add garlic, honey, and Aleppo-style pepper and whisk to combine. Whisk in oil and any accumulated juices on plate with chicken. Season vinaigrette with salt and black pepper.
6. Drizzle half of vinaigrette on a platter and set chicken on top. Serve with remaining vinaigrette alongside.

"To break the cauliflower into florets for the ""Cauliflower Cake"" recipe, follow these steps:

### Ingredients
- 1 small cauliflower, outer leaves removed, broken into 1 1/4-inch/3-cm florets (1 pound/450 g)
- 1 medium red onion, peeled (6 ounce/170 g)
- 5 tablespoons/75 ml olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary
- 7 eggs (scant 1 pound/440 g)
- 1/2 cup/15 g basil leaves, chopped
- 1 cup/120 g all-purpose flour, sifted
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/3 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 5 ounces/150 g coarsely grated Parmesan or another mature cheese
- Salt and black pepper
- Melted unsalted butter, for brushing
- 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon nigella seeds

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C.
2. Place the cauliflower florets in a saucepan and add 1 teaspoon salt. Cover with water and simmer for 15 minutes, until the florets are quite soft. They should break when pressed with a spoon. Drain and set aside in a colander to dry.
3. Cut 4 round slices off one end of the onion (each 1/4 inch/5 mm thick) and set aside. Coarsely chop the rest of the onion and place in a small pan with the oil and rosemary. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring from time to time, until soft. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Transfer the onion to a large bowl, add the eggs and basil, whisk well, and then add the flour, baking powder, turmeric, Parmesan, 1 teaspoon salt, and plenty of pepper. Whisk until smooth before adding the cauliflower and stirring gently, trying not to break up the florets.
4. Line the base and sides of a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm spring-form cake pan with parchment paper. Brush the sides with melted butter, then mix together the sesame and nigella seeds and toss them around the inside of the pan so that they stick to the sides. Pour the cauliflower mixture into the pan, spreading it evenly, and arrange the reserved onion rings on top. Place in the center of the oven and bake for 45 minutes, until golden brown and set; a knife inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean. Remove from the oven and leave for at least 20 minutes before serving. It needs to be served just warm, rather than hot, or at room temperature.

"After you drain the pasta, you should combine it with the following ingredients:

### Ingredients:
- 1 lb. short tube pasta (such as paccheri or rigatoni)
- Kosher salt
- 8 Tbsp. (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, divided
- 1 small regular lemon or Meyer lemon, very thinly sliced into rounds, seeds removed
- 1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated, plus more for serving
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions:
1. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling generously salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions (pasta will finish cooking in the sauce).
2. Meanwhile, heat half of the butter in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium until melted. Add lemon slices and cook, stirring often, until softened and bottom of pot is browned in spots, 5–7 minutes. Using tongs, transfer one-third of lemon slices to a plate; set aside.
3. Just before pasta is al dente, scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking liquid. Add 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid to butter sauce. (This may seem like a lot of liquid, but it will thicken once the remaining ingredients are added.) Add remaining butter a piece at a time, whisking until each piece is incorporated before adding more, until the sauce is emulsified and creamy.
4. Drain pasta and add to sauce. Cook, stirring often and adding 1 oz. Parmesan a little at a time. Once all of the cheese is added, continue to cook, still stirring, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy and clings to pasta, about 3 minutes. If sauce looks very thick, add more pasta cooking liquid 1–2 Tbsp. at a time to thin (saucier is ideal as it will thicken as it cools). Remove from heat and sprinkle with an almost ridiculous amount of pepper (about 2 tsp.); toss once more.
5. Serve pasta topped with reserved lemon rounds and more Parmesan.

"For the **Chestnut, Onion, and Currant Stuffing**, you will need a total of **3 1/2 cups of chicken broth**. 

### Ingredients
- 10 cups 1/4-inch dice seven-grain bread (about 1 pound)
- 2 large onions
- 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
- 3/4 pound vacuum-packed or canned whole chestnuts
- **3 1/2 cups chicken broth**
- 1 cup dried currants
- 1 cup packed fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- Garnish if desired: chopped fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 325° F.
2. In a large shallow baking pan toast bread in middle of oven until just dry, 15 to 20 minutes. Halve onions lengthwise and cut each half into 8 wedges. In a large heavy skillet cook onions in butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
3. If using canned chestnuts, rinse and drain. In a saucepan simmer vacuum-packed or canned chestnuts in 2 cups broth for 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in currants. Let mixture stand for 5 minutes.
4. Chop parsley. In a large bowl toss together bread, onions, chestnut mixture, remaining 1 1/2 cups broth, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste and cool completely. Stuffing may be made up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring stuffing to room temperature before proceeding.
5. Any frozen poultry destined for stuffing should be completely thawed, and the stuffing itself brought to room temperature before it's put into the turkey. Do not stuff your bird the night before you cook it; such a seeming time-saver can have dangerous results. Instead, it is best to loosely fill the bird's neck and body cavities immediately before roasting. And always use a meat or instant-read thermometer: The meat is done when the temperature of the thickest part of the thigh (be careful not to touch the bones) reaches 180°F.; the stuffing baked inside the bird is done at 160°-165°F. After roasting, let your stuffed poultry stand for 15 to 20 minutes, a double assurance that the requisite temperatures for food safety have been reached.
6. In a shallow baking dish bake stuffing in preheated 325° F. oven for 45 minutes (for moist stuffing, bake covered the entire time; for less moist stuffing with a slightly crisp top, uncover halfway through baking time).
7. Garnish stuffing with parsley.

"Yes, it is necessary to salt the eggplant before grilling it, particularly for some preparations. In the recipe for **Grilled Marinated Eggplant**, the author notes that they do not salt the eggplant before grilling, instead opting to grill it dry. However, in other recipes, such as the **Sweet-and-Sour Eggplant** and **Spicy Glazed Eggplant**, salting is a standard practice to draw out moisture and enhance flavor.

Here are the details from the **Grilled Marinated Eggplant** recipe:

### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 2 tablespoons drained capers
- 1 medium garlic clove, peeled and sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Sicilian
- 1/4 teaspoon minced peperoncini or red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 medium eggplant (3/4 pound), peeled and sliced about 1/3"" thick
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

### Instructions:
1. Finely chop the parsley with the capers and garlic. Add the oregano and peperoncini and chop everything together. Put the mixture in a bowl, stir in the oil, season with salt and pepper, and reserve.
2. Preheat an outdoor charcoal or gas grill or a grill pan until smoking hot.
3. Put enough eggplant slices on the grill to cover it without crowding. Cook the eggplant until well marked, 3 to 6 minutes, then turn the slices over. Cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Remove the eggplant from the grill.
4. Pour the vinegar into a shallow bowl. While still hot, dip each eggplant slice into the vinegar and set it aside on a plate. Continue grilling and dipping the eggplant until all the slices are cooked and seasoned.
5. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the parsley mixture onto a platter and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon. Arrange half of the grilled eggplant on the parsley in a single layer. Smear each slice of eggplant with more parsley. Place a second layer of eggplant on top and spread the remaining parsley on it. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and set aside to marinate at room temperature for about 2 hours (or refrigerate for longer). Serve at room temperature.
6. You could make the parsley mixture in a food processor, but I don't. I find hand chopping gives me the somewhat drier texture I prefer.
7. For this recipe, I don't salt or oil the eggplant; I grill it dry. This way, it has a nice chewy texture. I marinate the eggplant as soon as it comes off the grill so the flavor of the marinade penetrates.

3. Melt the 3 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour to the melted butter, whisking constantly. Continue to whisk for 2 minutes. Add the milk, 1/2 cup at a time, waiting until the mixture is thoroughly combined before adding more. Whisk constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens to the consistency of heavy cream, about 5 minutes.

"To ensure that the vegetables remain submerged while cooking in the curry, you can use a few techniques. In particular, when preparing dishes like **Carrot Curry**, you can cover the pot while cooking, which helps maintain moisture and ensures that the liquid surrounds the vegetables. Additionally, you might consider using a lid or a heavy object to weigh down the vegetables if they tend to float.

Here's a recipe you can follow for **Carrot Curry**:

### Ingredients
- 10 star anise pods
- 8 cardamom pods
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 1/2 tablespoons garam masala
- 2 pounds plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 6 shallots, minced (about 3/4 cup)
- 4 cups pure carrot juice
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
- Pinch of saffron threads
- 1 1/3 cups unsweetened coconut milk
- Kosher salt
- 8 large carrots, peeled and cut into 2- to 3-inch chunks
- Garnish: Coconut milk
- cilantro leaves
- fresh lime juice and zest
- rice

### Instructions
1. Put the star anise, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, and garam masala in a small dry skillet and toast over medium heat, stirring, just until fragrant, about 30 seconds; be careful not to burn the spices. Scrape onto a plate and set aside.
2. Grate the cut sides of the tomatoes on the large holes of a flat or box grater set over (or in) a bowl; discard the skins. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato puree and the toasted spices, then add the carrot juice and lime juice, bring to a simmer, and cook gently again until the sauce can easily coat the back of a spoon, about 30 minutes.
3. Add the saffron and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the coconut milk and cook for another few minutes to let the flavors get friendly. Remove from the heat and pick out and discard the whole spices. With an immersion blender, blend the sauce until smooth (or use a regular blender), then pour it into a smaller saucepan. Season with salt.
4. Add the carrots to the curry sauce and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender, about 35 minutes.
5. Spoon the curry into bowls and drizzle each serving with a bit of coconut milk. Garnish each bowl with cilantro leaves, lime zest, and lime juice. Serve with rice.

"To bake the **1-2-3-4 cake**, you should bake it in a preheated oven at 350°F for **25 minutes**. The cake is done when it **springs back when touched in the center**.

### Ingredients:
- Softened butter and flour, for the pans
- 3 cups sifted cake flour (not self-rising)
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon plain salt
- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 cups sugar
- 4 large eggs, separated, at room temperature
- 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest

### Instructions:
1. Butter and flour the bottom and sides of three 8 by 1 1/2-inch cake pans with the softened butter, tipping out the excess flour.
2. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until it is light, creamy, and fluffy, about 1 minute. Gradually add the sugar into the butter, and beat until the mixture is very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes more. As the sugar blends in it will change the color of the butter to a much lighter color, almost white.
3. Whisk the egg yolks in a small bowl until they are well blended. Gradually beat into the butter mixture, mixing well after each addition. With the mixer on low speed, starting with the flour mixture, add the flour mixture in thirds, alternating with two equal additions of the milk, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. In a clean bowl using clean beaters beat the egg whites until they form firm, glossy peaks. Do not overbeat until they are stiff and dry. Fold the whites into the batter.
4. Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pans, dividing it equally among them. Give the filled pans a little knock on the countertop to level the batter. Bake in the center of a preheated 350°F oven for 25 minutes, or until each cake springs back when touched in the center. Remove the pans from the oven and put them on wire cake racks to cool for a few minutes, then loosen the layers by running the flat side of a knife blade around the sides of the pans, put a rack on top of each pan, and invert so the cake comes out onto the rack, top side down. Then reverse the layers so they are top side up.
5. Mix the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar, and orange rind together and drizzle the mixture over the still warm cake layers, being careful not to let it all soak into one spot; then pile the layers on top of each other. Let the cake cool.

"To prepare the Raspberry, Whiskey & Oat Cheesecake, you should preheat the oven to **350°F**.

### Ingredients
- 150 grams (5.25 oz) oatcakes
- 25 grams (5 tbsp) regular rolled oats
- 1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons superfine sugar
- 100 grams (7 tbsp) unsalted butter
- 400 grams (14 oz) full-fat cream cheese
- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1/4 cup honey
- 100 grams (7 tbsp) superfine sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 to 3 tablespoons whiskey
- 3 large eggs
- 200 to 300 grams (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 c) fresh raspberries
- 8-inch round removable bottom or springform pan

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. To make the crust, crush the oatcakes with a rolling pin or in a food processor until sandy and no chunks remain. Stir in the rolled oats and sugar. Melt the butter over low heat in a small pan, then add it to the crushed oatcakes and stir to combine. Add a bit more butter if the mixture feels dry; it needs to be moist enough to hold together in small clumps. Spoon it into the pan and press firmly with the back of a spoon. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until just set (it will firm as it cools). Set aside while you prepare the filling. Turn the oven down to 250°F.
3. To make the filling, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add the sour cream and stir to combine, then add the honey, sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir in the whiskey to taste. (You can add a little extra, or none at all, if you prefer.) Lightly whisk the eggs in a separate bowl, then gradually add them to the cream cheese mixture while stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming. The mixture should be thick and smooth.
4. Pour the filling over the pre-baked crust. Bake for about 1 1/2 hours, until the filling is set and has just the slightest wobble in the center. Because it's baked at such a low temperature, it should be barely colored, just deepening to a light gold. Let cool to room temperature in the pan, then unmold and chill.
5. Shortly before serving, arrange the raspberries on top of the cheesecake, fat ends down and tapered bottoms upward. You can cover with the raspberries earlier, but there's a risk that, if they're particularly ripe, their juices will seep into the creamy cheesecake.

"If your sauce doesn't thicken as expected after adding the reserved milk, first ensure you are properly following the steps in the recipe. Specifically for the **Mac Sauce (Béchamel 101)**, remember that it should get thick when you first add the milk, and then thin as you pour in the remaining milk. If it still doesn't thicken, you can try the following:

1. Continue to cook the sauce over medium-high heat while whisking constantly. This should encourage it to come together and thicken.
2. Use the spoon test: Dip a metal spoon into the sauce. If it doesn't coat the spoon and slide off like milk, it likely needs more cooking.
3. If it becomes too thick later on, you can always add a little more milk to achieve your desired consistency, especially when melting cheese into the sauce.

Here's the relevant recipe to reference:

### Mac Sauce (Béchamel 101)

**Ingredients:**
- 3 cups whole milk
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt

**Instructions:**
1. Heat the milk in a pot over medium heat until it just starts to bubble but is not boiling, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
2. Heat the butter in a separate heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. When melted, add the flour, whisking constantly until light brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Gradually pour the warm milk into the butter-flour mixture, about 1 cup at a time, whisking constantly. It will thicken initially and then thin out.
4. Return the pot to medium-high heat, whisking constantly until the sauce thickens, around 2 to 3 minutes. Use the spoon test to check consistency.
5. The sauce is ready to use immediately or can be stored in the fridge for a few days. It may thicken after refrigeration, needing a bit of milk when reheating.

- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cane sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into pieces
- 1 tablespoon flaxseed or olive oil
- 1/4 cup (2 ounces) ice water, divided
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and set aside.
2. Sift the white spelt flour, white whole-wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together. Pour into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade (or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment). Add the chilled butter and pulse to create a coarse crumb mixture. With the food processor running, stream in the flaxseed oil, followed by the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture starts to form large clumps.
3. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and gather it into a ball. Knead gently once or twice. Sprinkle a little more flour on top of the dough and roll it out until it is 1/4 inch thick, rotating the dough by 90 degrees after each roll.
4. Prick the dough all over with a fork, making sure it is well pierced. Using a small cookie cutter of your choice, cut out the crackers and carefully place them on the prepared baking sheets.
5. In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg with the milk. Using a pastry brush, coat the tops of the crackers with the egg wash.
6. Bake just until the crackers begin to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
7. While the crackers are baking, stir the melted butter and salt together in a small bowl. Brush the mixture onto the freshly baked, still warm crackers before serving.

"The cake should chill in the refrigerator for **at least 2 hours or overnight** to ensure it sets properly before serving. 

Here are the details for **The Pink Cake**:

### Ingredients:
- Three 8 by 2-inch round cake pans, greased and bottoms lined with greased parchment paper circles
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 1/4 cup (1 ounce) lightly packed premium unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- 3/4 cup (6 3/4 ounces) full-fat sour cream
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup (7 1/2 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar
- 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 3 egg yolks, at room temperature
- 3 eggs, at room temperature
- Raspberry Buttercream

### Instructions:
1. Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Put the unsweetened chocolate and the cocoa into a small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the chocolate and allow it to steep for 1 minute. Whisk the mixture together. Whisk in the sour cream and vanilla. Set aside.
3. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, then whisk the mixture by hand to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed.
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and both sugars together on medium-high speed until light, about 3 minutes. As you make the batter, stop the mixer frequently and scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. On low speed, drizzle the oil into the mixture until blended. Turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat until the batter is fluffy, about 3 more minutes. Blend in the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, adding the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared into the batter. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the chocolate mixture in two parts, beginning and ending with the flour. After each addition, mix until just barely blended and stop and scrape the bowl. Stop the mixer before the last of the flour has been incorporated and complete the blending by hand with a rubber spatula to ensure you do not overbeat the batter.
5. Divide the thick batter equally among the prepared pans (there will be approximately 1 pound 2 ounces per pan). Smooth the tops and tap the pans on the counter to settle the batter and eliminate any large air bubbles. Bake in the middle of the oven until the centers spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Flip the cakes out of the pans, leaving on the parchment paper until you assemble the cake. Let them continue to cool on the rack, top sides up, until they reach room temperature.
6. To assemble the cake, lay one of the cakes top side up on a cake plate. Using a metal spatula, frost the top with 3/4 cup of buttercream, spreading it out to the edge of the cake (the filling will be about 1/4 inch thick). Stack the second cake top side up on top of the frosted cake and spread another 3/4 cup of buttercream on top of it. Stack the last layer of cake top side up on top. Look for any frosting that may have oozed out between the layers and spread it along the sides of the cake. Apply a thin layer of frosting all over the cake to create a ""crumb coat."" Place the cake in the refrigerator until the frosting is firm, about 10 minutes. Take it out and frost the cake with the remaining buttercream, using your spatula to make decorative swirls.
7. Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

2. Using an electric mixer on high speed (use whisk attachment if working with a stand mixer), beat eggs, lemon zest, and 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. sugar in a large bowl until mixture is very light, thick, pale, and falls off the whisk or beaters in a slowly dissolving ribbon, about 3 minutes if using a stand mixer and about 5 minutes if using a hand mixer. With mixer still on high speed, gradually stream in 1¼ cups oil and beat until incorporated and mixture is even thicker. Reduce mixer speed to low and add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with amaretto mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Fold batter several times with a large rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of bowl. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top, and sprinkle with more sugar.
   
3. Place cake in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Bake until top is golden brown, center is firm to the touch, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40–50 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes.

With a pastry brush, dust the slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch. Pull gently to separate the crescent shapes, dusting again with a bit more cornstarch. Add the carrot and sweet potato peels to the bowl and dust with the remaining cornstarch. Toss to distribute the vegetables evenly.
   
2. To make the summer pancakes, with a pastry brush, dust the bitter melon slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch, then place them in a bowl. Dust the zucchini slices and kabocha peels in a similar manner and add them to the bowl; toss to distribute evenly. Dust the shredded shiso leaves and chives with cornstarch and add them to the bowl; toss again to distribute evenly.

3. Make the batter just before frying: Place the ice cubes in a small bowl with half of the water. Sift the cake flour over the water and stir to mix slightly; there should still be lumps. If needed, add water, a few drops at a time, until the batter is the consistency of a thin pancake batter.

4. Pour the vegetable oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches into a small wok or small, deep skillet. Add the sesame oil and heat slowly. Check the temperature with an unvarnished long wooden chopstick (or a bamboo skewer). Small bubbles will form around the tip when the oil is about 350°F. Wait for about 45 seconds longer to allow the temperature to rise a bit more—to about 370°F—and then test the oil temperature with a few drops of batter. If they sink slightly, then rise to the surface and puff quickly but do not color, the oil is ready. You may need to fry the pancakes in batches to avoid crowding them in the pan. Preheat the oven to 200°F for keeping the cooked pancakes warm.

5. Spoon a bit of the batter over the cornstarch-dusted vegetables and toss lightly to coat the vegetables with the batter. Dip a large spoon or ladle into the hot oil. Place one-eighth of the vegetable mixture in the bowl of the oil-dipped spoon. Carefully tilt the spoon to slide the pancake into the hot oil, aiming to make a disk about 2 inches in diameter. The batter and cornstarch act as ""glue"" to keep the vegetable slivers together. Repeat to make more pancakes, being careful not to crowd the pan.

6. Most important, refrain from touching the pancakes for a full 30 seconds after you place them in the oil. It will seem like an eternity, but gaman will yield the best results. If wayward bits are strewn at the edges of your pan, carefully pick them up and place them on top of the still-moist pancake batter in the center. (Skill with long chopsticks will be well rewarded, though a long-handled fine-mesh skimmer can scoop beneath as well.) If the center of the pancake is very dry, dip the wayward bits in some fresh batter before ""gluing"" them in place. When the batter in the center of the disk seems barely moist, carefully invert the pancake.

7. After flipping, allow the pancakes to fry undisturbed for about 1 minute, or until crisp. Using cooking chopsticks or a skimmer, remove the pancakes from the oil and place them on a rack set over a baking sheet to drain. If frying in batches, place the baking sheet in the oven to keep the fried pancakes warm. Use the skimmer to clear the oil of batter bits between batches.

8. When all of the pancakes are fried, transfer them to paper towels to absorb any additional surface oil.

1. Whisk sugar, salt, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a large bowl to combine. Grate 1/2 cup butter on the large holes of a box grater directly into bowl (work quickly so the butter doesn’t soften too much in your hands). Thinly slice remaining 3/4 cup butter and add to bowl. Toss to coat butter, then quickly smash slices with your fingers into smaller, flatter pieces. Gradually drizzle in 7 Tbsp. ice water, tossing constantly with a fork to distribute. Using your hands, knead dough a couple of times in bowl to bring together in large clumps. Transfer clumps to a piece of plastic wrap, leaving dry bits behind. Toss dry bits in bowl, drizzling in more ice water by the teaspoonful as needed, until they hold together when squeezed in your hand (it will be very dry, which is normal). Add to dough on plastic and wrap tightly, forming into a 6"" square. Flatten, pushing dough into corners and pressing out any air pockets. Chill 2 hours.
2. Let dough sit at room temperature about 4 minutes to soften. Roll out on a lightly floured surface into a long rectangle about 1/4"" thick. Fold into thirds like a letter and rotate 90°F. Repeat rolling and folding process, dusting with more flour as needed. Rewrap tightly and chill at least 30 minutes before using.
3. Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.

"To ensure the chicken stays crispy after frying and when tossing it in the sauce, you can follow these techniques from the **Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken** recipe:

### Ingredients
- 4 cups buttermilk
- 1/2 tablespoon dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons Tabasco sauce
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 2 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2 frying chickens (about 3 pounds each), cut up
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- Olive oil or vegetable oil for frying

### Instructions
1. Combine the buttermilk, thyme, Tabasco, Worcestershire, 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the pepper in a nonreactive bowl large enough to contain all of the chicken pieces with at least 1 inch to spare. Add the chicken and turn to coat fully in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before frying.
   
2. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a large, shallow bowl, combine the flour, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, Cajun seasoning, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and roll it around in the seasoned flour until completely covered. Set it on the prepared baking sheet; repeat with the remaining chicken. Dip the coated chicken pieces once more in the marinade, then again in flour. Return the pieces to the baking sheet (a few minutes' rest makes for a sturdier, crisper coating).

3. Have a wire cooling rack set over paper towels ready. In a large, heavy Dutch oven, heat 1 1/2 inches of oil over medium heat until it reaches 350°F on a deep-fat thermometer. Using kitchen tongs, add a few chicken pieces at a time to the hot oil (crowding will lower the temperature, making for greasy chicken). Fry the chicken until the internal temperature reaches 180°F, about 10 minutes per side (watch carefully, it can easily burn). Transfer the cooked chicken to the wire rack. Serve immediately or at room temperature.

4. The chicken can be fried up to 2 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated. Serve it cold or reheat on wire racks set on baking sheets in a 375°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

5. If the chicken looks pretty dark before it is cooked through, transfer to wire racks set on baking sheets and bake in a 375°F oven until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 180°F on an instant-read thermometer. Keep fried chicken warm in a 200°F oven.

By allowing the chicken to rest after frying, you ensure a crispier exterior, and serving it with sauce on the side can help maintain its crunch.

"### Shaping Yaki Onigiri into a Triangular Form

To properly shape the rice ball (yaki onigiri) into a triangular form, follow these steps:

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups Japanese short-grain white rice
- 2 cups water

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Rice:** Use 1 cup of hot (or warm) cooked Japanese short grain rice per serving. 
2. **Jiggle the Bowl:** Add the rice to a small bowl (like a cereal bowl) just big enough to hold it. Jiggle the bowl, moving it in a flat, circular motion until the rice forms into a ball on its own. This helps pack the rice so it holds together when it grills.
3. **Wet Your Hands:** Wet your hands to prevent sticking and place the ball of rice between your cupped palms.
4. **Shape the Rice Ball:** Squeeze, flip, and turn the rice ball several times to form it into a triangular shape. Be careful not to compact the rice too tightly; you want it to just stick together.
5. **Grill the Yaki Onigiri:** Grill over medium heat, placing it along the cooler edges of a grill. Watch the rice carefully while it grills to prevent burning.

"If you want to make the frosting for the cupcakes thinner, you can gradually add milk to the frosting while beating until you reach the desired consistency. This method is particularly helpful if the frosting is too thick after mixing.

For example, in the recipe for **Lemon Cupcakes**, when making the frosting, it says: ""If the frosting becomes too thick, gradually add the milk, beating between each addition, until the desired consistency is achieved.""

Here’s the relevant recipe overall:

**Ingredients:**
- 1 box of your favorite cake mix
- 3 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 25 ounces lemon curd
- 1 pound confectioners sugar, sifted
- 1 to 2 tablespoons milk
- A selection of colored sugars

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a 12-hole muffin tin with 12 paper cupcake cases. Prepare the cake batter according to the package directions.
2. Fill each cupcake case with batter up to just below the rim of the paper. Cover and refrigerate the remaining cake batter.

- **A bunch of scallions, trimmed and finely sliced**
- **A large handful of mint leaves, shredded**
- **Juice of 1 lemon**

"You can indeed substitute different types of flour in the Cinnamon Rolls with Icing recipe. However, using flour that has different properties, such as whole wheat flour or all-purpose flour, may change the texture and flavor of the rolls. Ideally, you should stick to flours that are best for bread, such as all-purpose flour or bread flour, to achieve optimal results.

### Cinnamon Rolls with Icing

**Ingredients:**
- 2/3 cup whole milk
- 2 (1/4-ounce) envelopes instant yeast (4 teaspoons total)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 3 cups unbleached bread flour
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces and softened at room temperature
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and softened at room temperature, plus additional butter for greasing the pan and plastic wrap
- 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

With the mixer on medium, knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at warm room temperature for 1 hour.
4. In a medium bowl, use a rubber spatula to beat the butter until smooth. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla and beat until smooth and fully combined.
5. Line a 13- by 9-inch metal baking pan with parchment paper or foil, allowing 1 to 2 inches to hang over the long ends of the pan. Butter the parchment or foil.
6. Lightly flour a work surface and scrape the dough out of the bowl. Lightly flour the dough then gently press and pull it into a 12- by 18-inch rectangle. Dot the cinnamon butter all over the surface, then use a knife or small offset spatula to evenly spread it over the entire surface of the dough.
7. Starting at one of the 18-inch-long edges, roll up the dough, jellyroll-style. After rolling, push and gently squeeze the roll together to make it 18 inches long. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll into 12 (1 1/2-inch-thick) slices. One at a time, work the slices into an even round shape and arrange them, cut side down and about 1 inch apart on all sides, in the prepared pan.
8. Cover the pan with buttered plastic wrap and let the rolls proof at warm room temperature until they are puffed and starting to fill the spaces in between them, 1 to 2 hours.
9. Once you see the rolls puffing visibly, set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400°F. Place the pan in the oven, decrease the temperature to 375°F, and bake the rolls until they are well-risen and golden, about 25 minutes.
10. Cool the rolls in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Using the parchment paper or foil overhang, lift the rolls out of the pan and transfer to a work surface. DO AHEAD: Cinnamon rolls can be baked, cooled, and stored in an airtight container, up to 2 days. Warm the cinnamon rolls in a 350°F oven for about 10 minutes then ice them as described below.
11. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the butter and 2 tablespoons water, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted and the liquid is gently simmering. Remove the pan from the heat, add the confectioners' sugar, and use a small rubber spatula to stir the icing until it's thick and creamy.
12. Using a small spoon, drizzle about a tablespoon of the icing in the center of each roll and use the back of the spoon to spread the icing over the tops of the rolls. Let the icing set for about 10 minutes, then separate and serve the rolls.

"Salting the grated cucumbers in the recipe for Lamb Rack with Cucumber Yogurt serves the purpose of drawing out excess moisture from the cucumbers. This results in a less watery yogurt sauce, enhancing the overall flavor and texture of the dish.

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups plain Greek-style yogurt
- 2 cucumbers
- Salt
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 clove garlic

"Mixing the egg with the buckwheat groats before cooking them serves the purpose of coating the groats, ensuring that all the grains are separated from one another. This process helps to set the egg as the groats are heated, which prevents them from clumping together during cooking.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup buckwheat groats
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 2 cups reduced-sodium vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (regular or reduced-sodium)
- 2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar

Here are the ingredients used in the recipe:

- 3/4 cup Diamond Crystal or 7 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt
- 2 Tbsp. light brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp. freshly ground black pepper
- 4 skin-on, bone-in turkey legs (thigh and drumstick attached) and 2 split skin-on, bone-in turkey breasts (about 16 lb. total; from two 10–12-lb. turkeys)
- 4 sprigs rosemary plus 1/4 cup rosemary leaves
- 4 small or 2 large sprigs sage plus 1/4 cup sage leaves
- 4 sprigs thyme plus 1/4 cup thyme leaves
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, divided
- 3 heads of garlic halved crosswise, divided

1. Mix salt, brown sugar, and pepper with your fingertips in a medium bowl to combine.
2. Place turkey legs on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Place breasts on another wire rack set inside another rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle dry brine all over outside of turkey, patting to adhere and nudging into crevices (you won’t need all of the brine, but it’s good to have extra since some of it will fall onto the baking sheet). Chill, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.
3. Transfer turkey pieces to a large platter and rinse baking sheets and racks (turkey will most likely release some liquid onto pans). Line each baking sheet with 3 layers of foil, then set wire racks back inside. Place turkey legs and breasts skin side up on separate racks. Let sit at room temperature 2–3 hours.
4. Place oven racks in bottom and top third of oven; preheat to 450°F. Tie rosemary, sage, and thyme sprigs together with kitchen twine at bottom of stems so that they resemble an herb mop.

Reduce heat to low, add herb bundle stem side up, and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until butter is infused, about 15 minutes; discard garlic.
5. Mix rosemary, sage, and thyme leaves in a medium bowl. Loosen skin on turkey breasts and thighs. Using your palm, nudge small handfuls of herb leaves between flesh and skin. Arrange remaining 4 garlic halves around turkey pieces. Pour 1 cup water into each pan. Using herb bundle, baste turkey and garlic with infused butter. Roast turkey, basting with herb bundle and rotating pans top to bottom and front to back every 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 150°F and thickest part of thigh registers 165°F, 40–50 minutes (some pieces may be done faster than others, so check more than one piece each time).

"For the **Matzo Ball Soup**, you should use **1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of matzo meal**. Yes, it is possible to adjust the amount depending on your preference, but keep in mind that changing the amount of matzo meal may affect the texture and buoyancy of the matzo balls when cooked.

Here are the ingredients and instructions for making the soup:

**Ingredients:**
- 1/2 large chicken (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut into pieces or a combination of necks, backs, wings, and other chicken parts to equal 4 pounds
- 4 stalks celery, tops included, roughly chopped
- 3 to 4 carrots, roughly chopped
- 2 yellow onions, roughly chopped
- 1 small parsnip, roughly chopped
- 1 small turnip, peeled and chopped
- 1 tablespoon Kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 1 point of a star anise
- 4 sprigs fresh dill
- 5 large eggs
- 4 tablespoons hot chicken soup or water
- 3 tablespoons chicken fat (schmaltz), skimmed from the soup
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt plus more for cooking water
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons matzo meal

**Instructions:**
1. Place all of the ingredients except the dill in an 8-quart stock pot and add about 3 quarts of cold water to cover. Set over high heat and bring to a boil, skimming any froth that rises to the surface. Turn the heat down to low, set the cover ajar, and simmer for about 2 hours.
2. Add the dill and continue simmering an additional 45 minutes. Turn off the heat, cool to room temperature, and strain through a fine sieve. Refrigerate. If you can prepare the soup a day or two in advance, it will taste even better. Skim off any fat that coagulates on the surface and reserve the fat for the matzo balls.
3. A few hours before serving, prepare the matzo balls. In a large pot, bring the strained soup to a simmer. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, soup (or water), chicken fat, and salt. Beat in the matzo meal and refrigerate, uncovered, for 1 hour.
4. Bring about 5 quarts of water to a boil with 1 1/2 tablespoons Kosher salt dissolved in it. Remove the matzo meal mixture from the fridge. Wet your hands with cold water and gently shape about 2 tablespoons of the mixture into a sphere by rolling it around in the palms of your hands. Try not to compact the ball too much. Note that the matzo balls will swell to more than double their size when cooked.
5. Add the rolled matzo balls to the boiling salted water and repeat with the remaining mixture. Bring the water back to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer, tightly cover the pot, and cook for about 40 minutes until the matzo balls are floating on the surface, puffed, and snowy white. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the matzo balls to the hot soup. Keep warm until you are ready to serve.

- 1 cup peeled garlic cloves
- 1 lemon, cut into 8 wedges, seeds removed
- 1/2 cup olive oil

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Trim dark tops from green garlic and place in the chicken cavity; loosely tie legs together with kitchen twine. Halve green garlic bulbs and pale-green parts. Place chicken in a 2-qt. baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Tuck green garlic, garlic cloves, and lemon wedges around (make sure everything fits snugly to keep garlic from getting too dark); pour oil over. Roast, turning garlic and lemon occasionally, until chicken is very tender and garlic is soft and deeply caramelized, 2 1/2–3 hours. Serve chicken with garlic and lemon alongside.

"In the Chicken & Broccoli with Crispy Noodles recipe, besides almonds, you can use raw cashews as an alternative nut.

### Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon dry sherry
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 4 ounces thin rice sticks or rice noodles
- 1 1/2 pounds broccoli (1-2 heads), cut into small florets, stalks reserved for another use
- 1/2 cup skinless almonds or raw cashews
- 3/4 cup kecap manis or 3/4 cup soy sauce mixed with 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 3/4 cup Chicken Stock plus more if needed

### Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sherry and cornstarch. Add the ginger, then add the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Set aside.
2. Heat the oil in a wok or a 12-inch skillet over high heat until it reaches 350 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer. The rice sticks cook almost instantly, so have a slotted spoon and paper towels ready before you start. Take a handful of rice sticks, break into 2- to 3-inch pieces, and drop into the hot oil. They should puff immediately and become opaque—remove them as soon as they do to prevent burning and drain on the paper towels. Repeat, bringing the oil back to 350 degrees before you add more rice sticks, until all of them are cooked.
3. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil and return the pan to the heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the chicken, broccoli, and almonds and cook, stirring frequently, until the chicken is lightly browned all over, about 3 minutes.
4. Add the kecap manis and chicken stock and bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the broccoli is tender, 3 to 4 minutes; add a little more stock if the mixture becomes too dry.
5. Divide the chicken and broccoli among the plates, top with the crispy noodles, and serve.

Here is a quick overview of the ingredients and preparation for making rice noodles:

### Ingredients:
- 4 cups rice flour, plus more for dusting
- 3 1/2 cups water
- 3 tablespoons shallot oil or canola oil
- 1 cup tapioca starch

### Instructions:
1. In a bowl, whisk together the rice flour and 3 1/2 cups water until smooth. Cover and allow to ferment at room temperature for 4 days.
2. Carefully pour out 1 1/2 cups water from the settled rice flour. Add 1/4 cup fresh water to the batter and stir until smooth.
3. Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Keep the water hot while you prepare the dough.
4. In a heavy-bottomed 4- to 6-quart pot, heat the oil over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the batter and turn down the heat to low. This is a two-person job: one person needs to stabilize the pot while the other one quickly and firmly stirs the batter with a wooden spoon. The dough will begin to thicken. Continue cooking, stirring continuously, for 5 to 8 minutes, until the dough is a thick, firm paste. If any dough sticks to the sides of the pot, do not scrape it off.
5. Transfer the dough to a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and add tapioca starch. Mix on medium speed for about 10 minutes, until it forms a sticky ball.
6. Bring the water back to a boil, then adjust the heat to keep it at a vigorous simmer. Knead the dough for another 5 minutes until smooth.
7. Prepare an ice-water bath. Put 1 1/2 cups of the dough into a potato ricer, then extrude the noodles into the simmering water. Simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then transfer to the ice-water bath. Once cool, drain the noodles.

**Image:**

![Roast Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce](../data/Food_Images/roast-beef-tenderloin-with-port-sauce-240690.jpg)

### Ingredients
- 1 4- to 5-pound trimmed whole beef tenderloin, tail end tucked under, tied every 3 inches
- 2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) chilled unsalted butter, divided
- 1/4 cup finely chopped shallots
- 3 tablespoons Cognac or brandy
- 1 fresh rosemary sprig
- 1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper
- 1 cup ruby or tawny Port
- Simple Homemade Beef Stock
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons black peppercorns, coarsely cracked in mortar with pestle or in resealable plastic bag with mallet

### Instructions
1. Sprinkle the entire surface of the beef tenderloin with coarse kosher salt. Place the beef on a rack set over a large rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 24 hours and up to 36 hours.
2. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallots; sauté until soft, about 3 minutes. Add Cognac, rosemary, and 1 teaspoon cracked pepper, cooking until the liquid evaporates, about 1 minute. Add Port; bring to a simmer, then add all of the beef stock. Boil until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes. Strain into a medium saucepan, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids in the strainer. (This can be made 24 to 36 hours ahead; cool slightly, then cover and chill.)
3. Let the beef stand at room temperature for 1 hour before roasting. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Rub the beef all over with oil; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cracked peppercorns, pressing to adhere. Return the beef to the rack on the baking sheet and roast until the internal temperature reads 125°F for medium-rare (135°F to 140°F in the thinnest part) which takes about 30 minutes. Remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes.
4. Bring the sauce to a boil; whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

"You can substitute anchovies in recipes with various ingredients, depending on the desired flavor. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Olives**: Use finely chopped green or black olives for a salty, savory flavor, but bear in mind they will not melt into sauces like anchovies.

2. **Capers**: They provide a briny taste similar to anchovies but will add a bit more crunch.

3. **Miso paste**: For a umami flavor, a small amount of miso can be mixed into the dish.

4. **Worcestershire sauce**: It contains anchovies and can replace them in some cooked dishes like sauces or marinades.

5. **Soy sauce**: This can also be used in Asian-inspired dishes for a similar umami effect.

"For the filling in the Apple Pie, you will need **3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sugar**.

### Ingredients:
* 3 pounds (about 8) McIntosh apples
* 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into bits
* milk for brushing the crust
* 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into bits
* 2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons ice water plus additional if necessary

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Roll out half the dough 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface, fit it into a 9-inch (1-quart) glass pie plate, and trim the edge, leaving a 3/4-inch overhang. Chill the shell and the remaining dough while making the filling. In a large bowl toss together the apples, each peeled, cored, and cut into eighths, 3/4 cup of the sugar, the flour, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, the salt, and the lemon juice until the mixture is combined well, transfer the filling to the shell, and dot it with the butter.

"To braise goat meat in the oven, you should cook it at a temperature of **325°F** for approximately **6 to 7 hours** until the meat is almost falling off the bone. 

Here's the recipe context for your reference:

### Goat in Chile Marinade, Pit-Barbecue Style

#### Ingredients:
* 4 ounces guajillo chiles (about 16 large chiles), tops and seeds removed
* 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon whole cloves, or 3/4 teaspoon ground
* 10 allspice berries
* 1/3 cup dried Oaxacan oregano or 1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano, crumbled
* 12 to 15 large sprigs fresh thyme (leaves only), or 2 teaspoons dried
* 10 garlic cloves
* 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
* 1/2 cup cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon salt or to taste, plus additional for seasoning goat
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 16-pound goat, quartered, or 6 to 8 pounds lamb shoulder, bone in, trimmed
* 1/2 to 3/4 ounce dried avocado leaves
* about 30 large leaves

#### Instructions:
1. Wash and griddle-dry the chiles by the directions below. Place in a deep bowl and cover generously with boiling water. Let soak for at least 20 minutes.
2. Grind the cumin, cloves, allspice, oregano, and dried thyme (if using) together in an electric coffee or spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle.
3. Drain the soaked chiles. Working in batches as necessary, place them in a blender with the ground herbs and spices (add fresh thyme at this point if using), garlic, onion, vinegar, salt, and about 1/2 cup water (or enough to facilitate the action of the blades). Process to a smooth purée (about 3 minutes on high), stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. With a wooden spoon or pusher, for the purée through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. It should have the consistency of a thick but still moist paste.
4. Season the pieces of goat or lamb with salt and pepper. Slather the seasoning paste all over the meat. Arrange in a large bowl (or any non-reactive container that's large enough), cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator about 2 hours before beginning the cooking, to let the meat come to room temperature.
5. Preheat the oven to 325°F.
6. Choose a deep roasting pan or baking dish large enough to hold the meat snugly. Scatter half of the avocado leaves across the bottom of the pan and arrange the meat on them. Scatter the remaining leaves over the meat. Cover the pan (wrapping very tightly with several layers of foil if there is no lid) and bake 6 to 7 hours (4 to 4 1/2 hours for the lamb). The meat should be almost falling off the bone.

"The recommended depth for the purple candy coating when melting it for the Monster Pops is about **3 inches**. 

### Ingredients:
- 48 uncoated Basic Cake Balls, chilled
- 64 ounces (4 pounds) purple candy coating
- Deep, microwave-safe plastic bowl
- 48 paper lollipop sticks
- Styrofoam block
- Large squeeze bottle
- White candy writer
- Chocolate jimmies
- Blue edible-ink pen
- Black edible-ink pen

### Instructions:
1. Have the cake balls chilled and in the refrigerator.
2. Melt the purple candy coating in a microwave-safe plastic bowl, following the instructions on the package. The coating should be about 3 inches deep for easier dipping. (I usually work with about 16 ounces of coating at a time.)
3. When you are ready to dip, remove a few cake balls at a time from the refrigerator, keeping the rest chilled.
4. One at a time, dip about 1/2 inch of the tip of a lollipop stick in the melted candy coating, and insert the stick straight into a cake ball, pushing it no more than halfway through. Dip the cake pop into the melted coating, and tap off any excess coating. Hold the pop over the bowl in one hand, and tap your wrist gently with your other hand. If you use the hand holding the cake pop to shake off excess coating, the force of the movement will be too strong and could cause the cake ball to loosen or fly off the lollipop stick. Tapping the wrist holding the cake pop absorbs some of the impact. The excess coating will fall off, but you will need to rotate the lollipop stick so the coating doesn't build up on one side, making it too heavy on that side. If too much coating starts to build up at the base of the stick, simply use your finger to wipe it off, spinning the lollipop stick at the same time. This can happen if the coating is too thin or too hot. It's not as hard as it sounds; it just takes a little practice.
5. Let dry in a Styrofoam block.
6. Pour the remaining purple coating into a large squeeze bottle, and pipe random, drizzled lines all around the monster head. Let dry completely in the Styrofoam block.
7. On some of the pops, pipe two small white circles with a candy writer for the eyes, and insert 2 chocolate jimmies before the coating sets.
8. On the remaining pops, pipe a single large, white circle. Let dry completely and draw a large blue circle inside the white circle, using a blue edible-ink pen. With a black edible-ink pen, outline the circle and draw a pupil to finish the eye.
9. Let dry completely.

"In the ""Pork Stew with Sweet & Hot Peppers from the Abruzzo,"" you should sauté the onion for **about 10 minutes** until very soft before adding the garlic, which you then cook for an additional **3 minutes**. 

Here are the relevant ingredients and instructions:

### Ingredients:
- 6 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra as needed
- 2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, toasted and crushed

- One 28-ounce can crushed plum tomatoes with juice
- 2 large red bell peppers, cut into large dice
- Red wine vinegar (optional)

### Instructions:
1. In a skillet or large sauté pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat. Working in batches, brown the pork on all sides, adding more olive oil as needed and seasoning with salt and black pepper as you turn the meat. Each batch should take 8 to 10 minutes. When a batch is ready, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pieces to the tagine. Deglaze the pan with about one-half the wine and pour the juices over the meat.

"Yes, you can prepare the dough for the galette ahead of time. The dough for the **Fruit Galette** can be refrigerated for up to **overnight**. If you prefer to make it in advance, it should be wrapped in plastic and can be kept in the refrigerator for **at least 30 minutes** before using.

Here’s the recipe for the **Fruit Galette**:

### Ingredients
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes
- 3 to 5 tablespoons ice water
- 3 cups sliced fruit (plums, peaches, apples) and/or fresh or frozen berries
- 4 tablespoons sugar, plus more for dusting
- Pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

### Instructions
1. Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt, then add the cold butter and toss to combine. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you’ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the ½ tablespoon until it appears just moistened—a dough that’s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
3. Using the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
4. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, rotating 90 degrees after each roll, and adding a bit more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Drape the rolled dough over a rolling pin and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a clean rim of about an inch, and pile the fruit on top. Fold the crust around over the fruit, pleating rustically as you go. Brush the exposed pastry with water, then sprinkle generously—over the crust and the fruit, too—with sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake until the fruit juices are bubbling in the center and the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes, or more depending on the fruit.
5. Serve warm, with fresh whipped cream or ice cream, or cold, perhaps for breakfast, with yogurt.

Here’s a recap of the **Almond Cream** along with the ingredients and instructions:

### Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup almonds, preferably blanched
* 1/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling
* 1 large egg
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch of kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
* 1 package frozen puff pastry, preferably all-butter, thawed
* 12 apricots (about 1 1/4 pounds), halved and pitted, or other stone fruit, quartered if large

### Instructions:
1. Place a rack in the middle of the oven; preheat to 425°F. Pulse almonds and 1/3 cup sugar in a food processor until very finely ground. Add egg and pulse to combine. Add butter, almond extract (if using), vanilla extract, salt, and 1 Tbsp. flour; pulse until almond cream is smooth.
2. Roll out pastry on a lightly floured surface just to smooth out any creases.
3. If you’re using a package of pastry that has 2 sheets, stack and roll out to a 1/4""–1/8""-thick rectangle.
4. If your package contains a single 16x10"" sheet of puff pastry, halve it crosswise and roll out one half on a lightly floured surface until rectangle is 1/4""–1/8"" thick; save remaining half for another use. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Fold over edges of pastry to make a 1/2"" border around all sides. Prick surface all over with a fork (this keeps the pastry from rising too much when baked and helps it cook through). Spread almond cream over pastry, staying inside borders. (Chill dough in the freezer for a few minutes if it becomes too soft to work with.) Set apricots, cut sides up, on top of almond cream. Sprinkle lightly with sugar.
5. Bake galette until the pastry is golden brown and puffed, 15–20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F and continue to bake until pastry is deep golden brown and cooked through, and apricots are softened and browned in spots, 15–20 minutes longer.

- Small handful of cilantro roots, washed and minced
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- 2 tablespoons jaggery
- Juice of 2 limes
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 x 12 ounce (340 g) cans good quality peeled plum tomatoes
- Generous 3/4 cup (200 ml) coconut milk
- 10 ounces (300 g) wild garlic leaves

### Instructions:
1. Have the beans ready podded, or cooked if using dried beans. Heat the oil in a large heavy pan over medium-low heat and sweat the onions until soft and translucent.
2. In a separate pan, warm all the spice seeds until they release their fragrance and just begin to jump in the pan. Tip into a mortar and grind with the pestle while still warm.
3. Add the warm ground spices to the softened onions along with the chiles, curry leaves, lime leaves, and minced cilantro root. Cook for another 5 minutes over fairly low heat, then add the crushed garlic, jaggery, lime juice, and fish sauce. Stir well and cook for 5 minutes.
4. Add the tomatoes, stir well, and cook for another 10 minutes, then add the fresh or cooked dried beans and coconut milk. Cook gently for 10 to 15 minutes (or until the beans are tender if cooking fresh).
5. While the curry is cooking, wash the wild garlic very well, picking over each leaf thoroughly for they can carry little stones.
6. A couple of minutes before serving the curry, add the wild garlic and cook until it just wilts and softens. Don't overcook it—wild garlic should be bright and vibrant. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

1. Prick duck skin all over with a paring knife or carving fork; season with salt and pepper. Place duck on a large rimmed baking sheet. Toss with thyme, garlic, bay leaves, and juniper berries, pressing aromatics onto legs to adhere. Let sit 30 minutes (or preferably do this the day before; cover and chill).
2. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 225°F. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium and cook onion, carrots, and celery, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8–10 minutes. Add wine; bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 6–8 minutes. Add 1 cup water and slip duck legs (including aromatics), skin side down, into liquid. Cover and braise in oven on lower rack until duck is submerged in its fat, 1 1/2–2 hours. Turn duck skin side up and cook, covered, until tender (the bones will wiggle easily in the joint), 1 1/2–2 hours longer.
3. Transfer duck to a deep baking dish; strain liquid into a large measuring glass or medium bowl. Skim fat into dish with duck; set aside braising juices. Chill duck, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days (cover and chill juices if chilling duck more than a couple of hours).

"To grind the hazelnuts for the **Hazelnut Lace Sandwich Cookies**, you should pulse them in a food processor until they are finely ground. 

### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup blanched hazelnuts
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1/3 cup blueberry jam, strained
- Finely grated zest of 1 lime

### Instructions:
1. Pulse hazelnuts, flour, and salt in a food processor until nuts are finely ground; set aside.
2. Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until butter foams, then browns, about 5 minutes. Let cool about 5 minutes, then add granulated sugar, cream, maple syrup, vanilla, and 1 Tbsp. water and stir to incorporate. Return saucepan to medium heat and bring to a boil; cook, without stirring, 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir in hazelnut mixture. Scrape batter into a medium heatproof bowl and let cool, stirring occasionally to reincorporate the butter.
3. Meanwhile, place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325°F.
4. Scoop out rounded teaspoonfuls of batter and roll between the palms of your hands into smooth balls. Place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets at least 3"" apart. Because these cookies spread so much during baking, give each ball plenty of space. You should be able to fit 8 per sheet and will need to bake in 2 batches for a total of 32 cookies.
5. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until they spread into thin lacy disks and are deep golden brown around the edges, 10–14 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Repeat with remaining batter, using fresh parchment paper on baking sheets.

"To determine when the primary fermentation of your Basic Mead is nearly complete, you can monitor the carbon-dioxide bubbles escaping from the air lock. When the bubbles drop to one every sixty seconds, it indicates that fermentation has nearly concluded. This will typically take about two weeks to one month.

### Ingredients
- 12 to 18 pounds of grade-A honey
- 4 1/2 gallons of tap or bottled water
- 8 grams (1/4 ounce) of freeze-dried wine yeast, champagne yeast, or dedicated mead yeast

### Instructions
1. Making mead requires essentially the same basic kit necessary to brew beer at home: primary and secondary plastic-bucket fermenters with air locks and spigots, transfer hosing, a bottle-filler tube, heavy bottles, bottle caps, bottle capper, and a bottle brush and washer. You should be able to find these items for approximately $70 total (excluding the bottles) through a home-brewing supplier, such as The Home Brewery. Bottles cost from $6 to $20 per dozen, depending on style. You might instead buy a couple of cases of beer in returnable bottles, drink the beer, and — after sanitizing them! — reuse those bottles, for the cost of the deposit.
   
2. All your equipment must be sanitized or sterilized before use. Ordinary unscented household bleach does the job fine. Put all the equipment (including the lid and stirring spoons) into the fermentation bucket, fill with water, and add 2 teaspoons of unscented bleach. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Drain the water through the spigot, rinse everything in hot water, and allow to air-dry.

3. Bring the 4 1/2 gallons of water to a boil. Well water, by the way, should be avoided because of potentially high levels of strong tasting minerals like iron. Boiling should remove harsh chlorine from municipal tap water. If you don't own a pot large enough to hold five gallons of water, boil as much as possible. You will add the remaining water to the fermenter later.

4. Once the water reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and stir in all of the honey. Do not boil the honey, as it reduces the aromatic quality of the finished mead.

5. While the honey dissolves in the water, put a cup of lukewarm (90 to 100°F) water into a clean bowl. Sprinkle in the yeast and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. When the honey has been fully dissolved in the water and the pot is cool to the touch (not over 80°F), pour the honey-water into the fermentation bucket and stir in the yeast mixture. Note: Cooling the honey-water should take about half an hour. This process can be accelerated with a so-called sink bath, that is, repeatedly immersing the pot in cold water in a sink or basin.

6. If you have not already added the full 4 1/2 gallons of water, top it off with the balance in bottled water (or tap water if you're confident of its quality).

7. Seal the bucket and allow the mixture to ferment for two weeks to one month. The progress of fermentation can be judged by monitoring the carbon-dioxide bubbles escaping from the air lock: When they drop to one bubble every sixty seconds, fermentation has nearly concluded. Note that is only an issue during this primary fermentation; secondary fermentation has more to do with aging and mellowing and hence is more flexible. When primary fermentation has subsided, siphon the mead over to your secondary fermentation bucket and seal it. Allow one to four months aging time. Do not open the fermenter, as this risks contaminating the mead.

8. When you decide it has matured enough (and the mead has cleared), you will want to siphon it into sterilized bottles and cap them. Follow the same procedure as you would for home-brewed beer. My book Beer for Dummies has a detailed guide in its Chapter Ten, or consult the web site of the American Homebrewers Association.

9. Keep in mind that this is a recipe for still (i.e., non-carbonated) mead.

10. Mead typically improves with age, so the longer you can wait to open the bottles, the better.

- 1/2 cup soy sauce  
- 1/2 cup dry Sherry

- A dab of butter
- Mayonnaise
- A few slices American cheese or cheddar

"The puree for the pudding is made using **ripe bananas**. 

Here’s the recipe for **Banana Pudding**:

### Ingredients
- 5 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups whole milk
- 3 tablespoons banana liqueur (or 1 teaspoon banana flavoring)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 ripe bananas
- 1 cup vanilla wafers (about 15 cookies)
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter (melted)

### Instructions
1. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside. Bring the milk to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and whisk a little at a time into the egg mixture. Once the bottom of the bowl is warm, slowly whisk in the remaining hot milk. Pour the mixture back into a clean medium saucepan, add the banana liqueur, and whisk over medium-low heat until it thickens, about 2 minutes. Cook while constantly whisking until the pudding is glossy and quite thick, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the pudding to a clean bowl.

2. Add the vanilla and butter and gently whisk until the butter is completely melted and incorporated. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for 4 hours.

3. While the pudding sets, heat the oven to 325°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Place the wafers in a resealable plastic bag and seal (make sure there is no air in the bag prior to sealing). Using a rolling pin or a flat-bottomed saucepan or pot, crush the vanilla wafers until they're coarsely ground. Transfer them to a small bowl and stir in the sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Use a spoon to evenly stir in the melted butter, transfer to the prepared baking sheet, and toast in the oven until brown and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

4. Slice the bananas in half crosswise and then slice in half lengthwise so you have 4 quarters. Slice the banana quarters crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces and divide between 6 custard cups or martini glasses (sprinkle with a squeeze of lemon juice if you like—this helps prevent browning).

"To prepare **Carciofi alla Giudea**, you will need **12 baby artichokes**. Here's what you should do with them:

### Ingredients:
- 3 lemons, divided
- 12 baby artichokes
- Olive oil (for frying)

### Instructions:
1. Cut 1 lemon in half. Squeeze juice into a large bowl; add lemon halves. Fill bowl 2/3 full with water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, break off dark outer leaves until only pale green leaves remain. Trim the end off the stem and cut 1/2 inch off the top of the artichoke; add to lemon water. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.
2. Fill another large bowl with ice water. Blanch artichokes in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for 10 seconds; transfer to ice water to cool completely. Remove artichokes from water and shake off excess moisture. Gently pry open leaves and press as flat as possible. Invert artichokes onto a paper-towel-lined work surface and press to hold leaves open. Drain for 30 minutes (this can be prepared 4 hours ahead; cover with plastic and let stand at room temperature).

"After shaping the dough into discs, you should refrigerate it for about **15 minutes** before stretching. This helps with easier handling of the dough.

### Ingredients:
- 1 1/4 cups warm water (95°)
- One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 3 1/2 cups of ""00"" flour
- Scant 2 tablespoons salt
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Semolina for dusting

### Instructions:
1. Whisk the warm water, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.
2. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix well. With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and oil, mixing well. Continue to mix, gradually increasing the mixer speed to medium-high, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and give it a few turns by hand to finish kneading it; it will still be slightly sticky.
3. Alternatively, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until the mixture is too stiff to stir, then mix with your hands in the bowl until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto the lightly floured work surface and knead, adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth elastic, and only slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.
4. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. Divide it into 8 pieces (about 4 ounces each) and shape each one into a ball. Cover with a tea towel and let stand for 15 minutes before stretching the dough. Or, for easier handling, transfer the balls to a floured baking sheet and refrigerate until cold.
5. Dust a large work surface with a mixture of flour and semolina. If the dough has been refrigerated, transfer one ball to work surface and let stand just until still cool but not cold (about 60°F if tested with an instant-read thermometer).
6. Meanwhile, preheat the griddle pan over medium heat until very hot, about 5 minutes.
7. Using your hands, begin to press and stretch the dough into a 9- to 10-inch round, adding only enough additional flour and semolina to the work surface to keep the dough from sticking.
8. Carefully place the dough round on the pre-heated griddle pan and cook until barely tan on the first side and browned in a few spots.
9. Transfer the crust to a wire rack or baking sheet, brushing off any excess flour, and allow to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough.

3. In a 12-inch (30.5-cm) skillet, heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the colors brighten, about 3 minutes. Cover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and reducing the heat as needed to prevent browning, until very tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside. Reserve the skillet.
4. Break the matzo sheets into small pieces into a medium bowl and pour in water to cover. In another medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper until the eggs are well blended. Drain the matzos (don’t be too fussy; just tilt the bowl to pour off the excess water, using your hand to prevent them from tumbling out). Stir the egg and leek mixtures into the matzos.
5. Reheat the skillet with the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and oil over medium heat. The pan is hot enough when a bit of matzo mixture dropped into it sizzles on contact. Pour in the matzo brei batter and smooth the top and edges. Cook, reducing the heat to medium-low as needed to prevent scorching, until the underside is set and golden, about 5 minutes.
6. Use the edge of a pancake turner or spatula to cut the matzo brei into 6 wedges. Flip each wedge, rotating the pan as you go so that the pieces fit back into the pan nicely. Continue to cook until the matzo brei is cooked through but not dry, about 3 minutes more. (If you must add more fat to the pan during cooking, tilt the pan, add the fat to the side of the pan still resting on the burner, and hold the pan at this angle for a moment to heat the fat. Then, use your spatula to lift the edge of the matzo brei and tilt the pan in the opposite direction to let the warmed fat run under the matzo brei before you set the pan back squarely on the burner to finish cooking.)
7. Place a wedge of matzo brei on each plate. Drape each wedge with salmon, top with a spoonful or two of horseradish cream, and shower with dill. Use a five-hole zester to zest long strands of lemon peel over each serving and add a squeeze of lemon.

"The purpose of dissolving gelatin in cool water before adding it to the coffee is to allow the gelatin to bloom, which means it absorbs the water and swells. This process ensures that the gelatin dissolves evenly when mixed with the hot coffee, preventing clumping and ensuring a smooth texture in the final product.

Here is the recipe for **Frozen Iced Coffee With Coffee Jelly**:

### Ingredients
- 1 (1/4-ounce) envelope powdered unflavored gelatin (about 1 tablespoon)
- 2 cups freshly brewed hot coffee
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups cooled coffee
- 1/4 cup chocolate syrup
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- Bubble tea or other wide straws

### Instructions
1.  Dissolve gelatin in 3 Tbsp. cool water in a small bowl. Let stand until bloomed, about 2 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, combine hot coffee and sugar in a loaf pan or large resealable container. Gently stir gelatin mixture into coffee until combined (do not stir too vigorously or air bubbles will appear). Chill until firm, about 2 hours.
3.  Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed or a whisk, whip cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Add sugar and vanilla and whip to medium peaks.
4.  Blend coffee, syrup, cream, sugar, vanilla, and 3 cups ice in a blender until smooth.
5.  Cut coffee jelly into 3/4” cubes. Fill 4 tall glasses with 1/2 cup cubed coffee jelly each. Spoon 3 Tbsp. whipped cream over each and spread to create a solid layer of cream. Divide frozen iced coffee (about 1 cup each) among glasses on top of cream layer. Top with more whipped cream and serve immediately with bubble tea straws.

"You can substitute other sauces for awaze in the Shimbra Wat, although it may alter the flavor profile of the dish. For example, you might consider using Zhoug, a spicy herb sauce, which could provide a different but delicious kick. Here's the recipe for Shimbra Wat:

### Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons brown or golden flaxseed
* 3 tablespoons awaze dipping sauce (or substitute with Zhoug)
* 14 oz (400 g) cooked or canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* Salt

### Instructions
1. Heat a small dry frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the flaxseed and lightly dry-toast for about 2 minutes, stirring and shaking the pan, until aromatic. Transfer to a dish and leave to cool. Once cool, grind using an electric spice or coffee grinder.
  
2. In a Dutch oven or sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of water over low heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of the awaze (or substitute). Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously, then gradually work in the remaining 2 tablespoons of awaze (or substitute), along with the ground flaxseed and 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Reduce the heat to its lowest possible level, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes. Add a touch more water if it looks like the mixture is drying out—it should still be a bit runny at the end.

3. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas in a saucepan and cover with 2 cups (500 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and soak in the liquid until ready to use. Drain the chickpeas, reserving about 1 cup (240 ml) of the liquid. Add the chickpeas to the awaze-flaxseed mixture, generously season with salt, and mix well. Tip in some of the reserved cooking water if needed so that the sauce is a touch runny and evenly coats the chickpeas. Cook for a couple of minutes to combine the flavors before serving.

"Before cooking the chicken cutlets in the ""Make-Ahead Crispy Chicken Cutlets"" recipe, the broiler should be set to **450°F**. 

### Ingredients:
* 2 large egg yolks
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 2 tsp. kosher salt
* 4 lb. skinless, boneless chicken cutlets, pounded 1/4"" thick (for smaller pieces, quarter cutlet before pounding)
* 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 6 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
* 2 Tbsp. mustard powder
* garlic powder
* finely grated Parmesan
* or dried herbs (optional)

### Instructions:
1. Whisk egg yolks, mayonnaise, and salt in a large bowl until smooth. Add chicken and turn several times with tongs until evenly coated.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add panko and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, making sure to get around the edges to incorporate darker breadcrumbs, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly, then stir in mustard powder, if using.
3. Using tongs, place a cutlet in skillet. Pat surrounding toasted panko onto cutlet with one of your hands, pressing firmly to adhere. Turn and repeat on the other side with more breadcrumbs. Lightly shake off excess breadcrumbs. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet (if you are making these ahead and freezing, skip wire rack and place directly on a baking sheet). Repeat with remaining cutlets, spacing evenly apart on baking sheet. Discard any remaining panko. At this point, breaded cutlets can be frozen up to 3 months. Freeze chicken on baking sheets until firm, about 1 hour, then transfer to resealable freezer bags or layer in an airtight container with sheets of parchment between cutlets.

"For the **Lavender Crème-Caramel Tart**, if you need to substitute ingredients, you can consider the following:

- **Heavy Cream**: You can use half-and-half or a mixture of whole milk and cream, though the texture and richness may differ.
- **Whole Milk**: You may substitute with any other type of milk such as almond milk or oat milk, though it might affect the final flavor.

Here are the ingredients you'll need for the tart:

### Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 3 tablespoons dried nontoxic and organic lavender flowers
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs
- 3 large egg yolks
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, slightly softened
- 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons ice water
- Garnish: fresh nontoxic and organic violets
- a 10-inch glass pie plate (1 to 1 1/2 inches deep)
- 9 1/2-inch plate or cardboard round
- and 10- to 14-inch flat serving plate with a slight lip

### Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Cook 1 cup sugar in a dry large nonstick skillet over moderate heat, swirling and shaking pan (to help sugar melt evenly), until sugar is melted and caramel is deep golden. Immediately pour caramel into pie plate, tilting to coat bottom and sides evenly.
3. Bring cream, milk, lavender, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar to a simmer and remove from heat. Let stand 15 minutes, then reheat. Pour through a fine sieve into a bowl, discarding lavender. Whisk whole eggs and yolks together in a bowl and slowly whisk in hot cream mixture. Pour custard over caramel.
4. Bake custard in a water bath in the middle of the oven until set but still trembling slightly (custard will continue to set as it cools), 40 to 45 minutes. Remove pie plate from water and cool crème caramel on a rack. Chill, loosely covered with plastic wrap, at least 2 hours.
5. Blend together flour, sugar, salt, and butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Drizzle 1 1/2 tablespoons ice water over the mixture and toss with a fork until incorporated. Test mixture by gently squeezing a small handful: When it has the proper texture, it should hold together without crumbling apart. If necessary, add remaining tablespoon of water.
6. (If you overwork the mixture or add too much water, pastry will be tough.) Turn mixture out onto a work surface and divide it into 4 portions. Smear each portion once in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together and form it into a disk.
7. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour.
8. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface into a 10 1/2-inch round and slide onto a baking sheet. Trim dough to a 9 1/2-inch round (use a 9 1/2-inch plate turned upside down as a guide). Prick round all over with a fork and chill 30 minutes. Bake round in the middle of the oven until golden, 20 to 25 minutes, and cool completely on the baking sheet on a rack.
9. Run a thin knife around the edge of the crème caramel and rotate the pie plate back and forth to make sure it is loosened. Slide the crust on top of the crème caramel, centering it carefully, and invert a serving plate on top of the crust. Invert the tart onto the serving plate (caramel will run to the edge of the plate).

"To make the **Perfect Poached Eggs**, you will need:

* 4 large eggs
* Kosher salt
* freshly ground pepper

Here are the instructions to prepare them:

1. Bring a large saucepan of water to a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl. Let watery whites run through into bowl below; carefully transfer egg to a small bowl (this helps eliminate the long, tentacle-like strands of egg white that may otherwise form, and encourages a smooth, round poached egg).

2. Stir simmering water with a slotted spoon to make a gentle vortex. Tip egg out of bowl into center of vortex and swirl water gently to help bring whites up around yolk. Repeat with 3 more eggs so there are 4 eggs total in saucepan. Cook until whites are just set but yolk is still very soft (lift out of water with a slotted spoon and gently press on yolk to assess), about 2 1/2 minutes from the time each egg hits the water. Transfer to a warm plate with a slotted spoon. Season eggs with salt and pepper just before serving.

3. Eggs can be poached 1 day ahead. Transfer to a bowl of ice water instead of a warm plate. Cover and chill. Reheat in barely simmering water 1 minute before serving.

### Instructions:
1. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to **350°F**.
2. Toast hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan in oven until skins split and nuts are golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven (leave oven on), then wrap hazelnuts in a kitchen towel and let steam 5 to 10 minutes. Rub hazelnuts in towel to remove loose skins (some skins may not come off), then transfer hazelnuts to a small bowl, discarding skins. While hazelnuts steam, toast almonds in baking pan until golden, 5 to 8 minutes, then add to bowl with hazelnuts. Lightly grease pan and set aside.
3. Cook sugar in a dry small heavy skillet over moderate heat, swirling skillet, until sugar begins to melt, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling skillet, until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and, working quickly, stir in nuts to coat, then transfer mixture to greased baking pan, spreading slightly. Let stand at room temperature until hardened and cool, about 30 minutes.
4. Transfer praline to a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag and seal bag, pressing out excess air. Coarsely crush praline in bag using a rolling pin or bottom of a heavy skillet, then transfer three fourths to a food processor and purée until it becomes a smooth, creamy ""butter,"" 3 to 4 minutes. Reserve remaining crushed praline for garnish.
5. Bring milk to a simmer in a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat. While milk heats, whisk together yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a heatproof bowl.
6. Add hot milk to yolk mixture in a stream, whisking, then transfer mixture to saucepan and bring to a simmer over moderate heat, whisking (mixture will become thick and lumpy). Simmer, whisking constantly, 3 minutes (mixture will become smooth). Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla. Transfer to a clean bowl and chill pastry cream, its surface covered with wax paper, until cold, at least 1 hour.

9. Bring water to a boil with butter, granulated sugar, and salt in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over high heat, then reduce heat to moderate. Add flour all at once and cook, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon, until mixture pulls away from side of pan, about 1 minute. Continue to cook and stir vigorously (to dry out mixture) 3 minutes more. Remove pan from heat and cool mixture, stirring occasionally, until warm to the touch, 5 to 10 minutes. Add whole eggs 1 at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition until dough is smooth.
10. Transfer dough to pastry bag fitted with plain tip and pipe 3 concentric rings to fill space between traced circles on parchment, then pipe 2 more on top to cover seams between bottom rings. Lightly brush pastry with some egg wash, then scatter almonds over pastry and dust with 1 tablespoon confectioners sugar.
11. Bake choux pastry until golden and well puffed, 20 to 25 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to **375°F** and continue to bake until deep golden and firm to the touch, about 25 minutes more. Immediately prick top of pastry in 8 to 10 places with tip of a small sharp knife (to release steam) and continue to bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Transfer pastry (on parchment) to a rack and cool completely, about 30 minutes.
12. Halve pastry horizontally with a serrated knife and carefully invert top onto work surface. Remove and discard any wet dough from interior of top and bottom. Transfer hazelnut cream to cleaned and dried pastry bag fitted with star tip and pipe cream decoratively into bottom half of pastry, then carefully reinvert top half over it. Sprinkle top with reserved praline and dust with additional confectioners sugar.

Chill at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours (letting the lamb marinate longer will really allow the flavors to meld and permeate the meat).
3. Remove lamb from refrigerator and let sit to come to room temperature, about 1 hour (this facilitates even cooking).
4. Preheat oven to 450°F. Roast lamb until well browned all over, 20–25 minutes. Remove from oven and reduce oven temperature to 300°F.
5. Meanwhile, heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in a Dutch oven or other heavy pot large enough to fit lamb over medium. Add onion, fennel, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and golden, 15–20 minutes. Add chiles de árbol and wine and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat.
6. Carefully place lamb in pot and pour in water to come halfway up sides of meat. Place in oven and braise lamb, uncovered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120°F, about 1 hour. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes.
7. Slice lamb and transfer to a platter. Spoon some braising liquid over and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve with salsa verde and harissa.

"To make Vanilla Cream–Filled Doughnuts, you should refrigerate the dough for **at least 6 hours or up to 15 hours**. Freezing the dough is not specifically mentioned, but you can chill it, which serves a similar purpose of firming up the dough for easier handling.

### Ingredients:
- 1 package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast
- 2/3 cup (160 grams) milk, at room temperature
- 3 1/2 cups (490 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 1/3 cups (270 grams) sugar
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 3 eggs
- 7 tablespoons (3/4 stick/100 grams) butter, at room temperature
- Canola oil, for frying
- 6 tablespoons (90 grams) heavy cream
- Pastry Cream

### Instructions:
1. In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast and milk. Stir together briefly, then let sit for about 1 minute to dissolve the yeast. Add the flour, 1/3 cup (70 grams) of the sugar, the salt, and the eggs and mix on low speed for about 1 minute, or until the dough comes together. Then, still on low speed, mix for another 2 to 3 minutes to develop the dough further. Now, begin to add the butter, a few pieces at a time, and continue to mix for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough is soft and cohesive.
2. Remove the dough from the bowl, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 15 hours.
3. Lightly flour a baking sheet. On a well-floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 12-inch square about 1/2 inch thick. Using a 3 1/2- to 4-inch round biscuit cutter, cut out 9 doughnuts. Arrange them on the prepared baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a warm spot to proof for 2 to 3 hours, or until they are about doubled in height and feel poufy and pillowy.
4. When ready to fry, line a tray or baking sheet large enough to hold the doughnuts with paper towels. Pour oil to a depth of about 3 inches into a large, heavy saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until hot. To test the oil, throw in a pinch of flour. If it sizzles on contact, the oil is ready. (It should be 350 degrees if you are using a thermometer.) Working in batches, place the doughnuts in the hot oil, being careful not to crowd them. Fry on the first side for 2 to 3 minutes, or until brown. Then gently flip them and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until brown on the second side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the doughnuts to the prepared tray and let cool for a few minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
5. Place the remaining 1 cup (200 grams) sugar in a small bowl. One at a time, toss the warm doughnuts in the sugar to coat evenly. As each doughnut is coated, return it to the tray to cool completely. This will take 30 to 40 minutes.
6. To make the vanilla cream filling: While the doughnuts are cooking, whip the heavy cream until it holds stiff peaks. Using a rubber spatula, fold it into the pastry cream. You should have about 3 cups.
7. When doughnuts are completely cooled, poke a hole in the side of each doughnut, spacing it equidistant between the top and bottom. Fit a pastry bag with a small round tip and fill the bag with the filling. Squirt about 1/3 cup filling into each doughnut. Serve immediately.

"Freezing the butter before mixing it with the flour for the pastry serves to keep the butter cold. This is crucial as it ensures that the butter maintains its solid form while being mixed, which ultimately leads to a flakier pastry. When butter melts in the mixture, it can create a denser texture in the finished pastry, rather than the desirable light and flaky structure.

### Recipe for **No-Stress All-Butter Pastry Crust**

**Ingredients:**
- 1 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon | 8 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting
- 1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
- 2 sticks (8 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1/2 cup (4 ounces) cold water

**Instructions:**
1. Sift flour into a medium bowl (if using cup measures, spoon into the cups and level with a knife before sifting). Whisk in sugar and salt. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes, no smaller, and toss with flour to break up the pieces. Roughly smash each cube flat—nothing more! Stir in cold water and knead until the dough comes together in a ball. With a dough temperature at or below 70°F, it will feel dry to the touch.
   
2. Transfer to a generously floured work space, sprinkle with more flour, and roll into a 10-by-15-inch sheet. Fold each 10-inch side toward the middle, and close the packet like a book. Fold top to bottom to make a thick block, then cut in half. Using as much flour as needed, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Brush off excess flour, drape over a 9-inch tempered glass pie plate, making sure it’s flush against the pan.
   
3. Trim excess dough into a 1 1/4-inch overhang all around, then fold over to create a 3/4-inch border that sits on the rim of the plate; if positioned inside the rim, the crust will be too shallow to accommodate the filling. Pinch or press the border into a zigzag pattern, and repeat with remaining dough. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight. Alternately, formed crusts can be frozen up to 3 months and thawed in a refrigerator before use.

4. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line the chilled crust with a large strip of foil (not parchment or wax paper), letting the excess loosely cover the rim. Fill with plain white sugar, a delicious alternative to options like rice or beans.
   
5. Bake on an aluminum baking sheet until fully set and golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and carefully lift out the foil, setting it aside until the sugar has cooled. If the sides of the crust seem puffy or pale, continue baking 10 minutes more. Cool to room temperature. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours.

6. If the temperature climbs above 73°F in your kitchen, be aware that everything from your countertop to your rolling pin and the flour itself will act as a heat source to the butter. Combat these conditions by refrigerating your pie plate, rolling pin, and dry ingredients until cool—not cold or frozen.

"If the oil turns dark while browning the veal shanks, discard the dark oil and heat a fresh cup of oil to continue the browning process. This ensures that your veal shanks will be cooked in clean oil, which improves the overall flavor of the dish.

### Ingredients:
- Four 12-ounce veal shanks
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup vegetable oil (for browning; you may need to add more if the first batch darkens)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 celery ribs, diced
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 6 garlic cloves, sliced
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 4 cups veal stock or chicken stock

### Instructions:
1. Lay the veal shanks in a shallow baking pan and sprinkle liberally on both sides with salt. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
2. Rinse the veal shanks of their salt and pat dry with paper towels. Wrap each veal shank once around the circumference so that it holds the bone and meat together in the center. Tie the twine with a good knot. Season the veal shanks with pepper.
3. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
4. Heat a large, ovenproof casserole over high heat. Put the oil into the casserole and let it heat.
5. Meanwhile, put the flour in a shallow bowl, dredge the veal shanks in it, and pat off the excess. Brown the veal shanks in the hot oil for about 5 minutes on each side, or until browned on all sides. Remove from the pan and set aside. If the oil turns dark during the process, discard it and heat a fresh cup of oil.
6. Add the carrots, celery, onion, and garlic to the pan and cook over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the wine, bring to a boil, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until reduced by half.
7. Add the stocks, tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf to the pan. Return the veal shanks to the pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Once the liquid boils, cover, transfer to the oven, and cook for 2 1/2 hours, until the meat is fork tender and falling off the bones.
8. Remove the herbs from the braising liquid and discard. Let the veal shanks come to room temperature in the braising liquid. Remove the veal shanks and set aside. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or chinois into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until reduced by a quarter. Using a skimmer or large spoon, skim off any grease or foam that rises to the surface. Return the strained vegetables to the liquid and taste for seasoning.
9. To serve, cut and discard the twine, put a single osso buco (veal shank) in a bowl, and ladle about 3/4 cup of the sauce and vegetables over it. (If the sauce and the meat are not still warm, heat them together very gently over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes.)

"To ensure the black sesame seeds remain shiny during the frosting process, you should toss the black sesame seeds with a little vegetable oil before using them. This coating helps keep them jet-black and shiny during the frosting.

Here is a related recipe to consider:

### Black and White Sesame Seed Cookies

#### Ingredients:
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 cups cake flour, plus more
- 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1/2 cup black sesame seeds
- 1/4 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup white sesame seeds
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
- Pinch of kosher salt
- A 3""-diameter cookie cutter

#### Instructions:
1. Whisk baking powder, salt, and 3 cups cake flour in a small bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat butter and sugar in a medium bowl until well combined (butter does not need to be fluffy), about 3 minutes. Add egg and egg yolk and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low and gradually mix in dry ingredients. Divide dough in half and form into 3/4""-thick disks. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, about 2 hours.
2. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 325°F. Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, shifting often on sheet and dusting with more flour as needed to keep from sticking, until about 1/4"" thick. Punch out rounds with cookie cutter and transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 1/2"" apart. Pat scraps into a 3/4""-thick disk. Chill 15 minutes.
4. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until edges are golden brown, 12-15 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks and let cool. Cut out and bake scraps, then repeat process with remaining disk of dough.
5. Dough can be made 1 month ahead; freeze. Cookies can be baked 2 weeks ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Thaw before decorating. Frosting and Assembly Toss black sesame seeds and oil in a medium shallow bowl to coat seeds (this will keep them jet-black and shiny). Place white sesame seeds in another medium shallow bowl.
6. Whisk powdered sugar, lemon juice, salt, and 1/3 cup water in a large bowl until smooth. Place half of the icing in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/8"" tip. (Or use a large resealable plastic bag and cut a small opening in 1 corner.)
7. Working with 1 cookie at a time, pipe down center and then around the edge of half of the cookie to create a semicircle. Pipe icing inside border to fill, then use a small offset spatula to evenly spread over half of the cookie. Working quickly so icing is still wet, dip frosted part of cookie into white sesame seeds, patting gently to adhere, then letting excess fall back into bowl. Let sit 15 minutes for icing to set.
8. Repeat process on the other half of the cookie, dipping into black sesame seeds, and let sit at least 20 minutes before serving.
9. Cookies can be frosted and decorated 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Watch closely so as not to burn the butter. Pour the browned butter into a medium bowl and stir in the brown sugar and vanilla. In a small bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder together. With a spoon, stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until combined. Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls onto the cookie sheet. Sprinkle with sea salt and lightly press it into the top of cookies. Bake for 12 minutes.

"To determine when pears are tender enough while cooking them in the skillet, you can pierce them with a paring knife. They should feel tender when pierced, which typically takes about 12 minutes of cooking with the heat set to medium. Additionally, you can swirl the skillet occasionally and add water to the skillet if the caramel sauce turns too brown before the pears reach the desired tenderness.

Here’s a recipe that highlights this technique:

### Pears in Honey and Pine Nut Caramel with Artisanal Cheese

#### Ingredients
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
- 3 firm but ripe Bosc pears or other pears, peeled, halved lengthwise, cored
- 3 1/2 tablespoons mild honey (such as orange blossom or clover)
- 4 ounces artisanal cheese (such as Point Reyes Original Blue, Humboldt Fog, dry Monterey Jack, sheeps-milk ricotta, tangy soft fresh goat cheese, or other local cheese), sliced or crumbled, room temperature
- 3 tablespoons pine nuts
- Pinch of fine sea salt

#### Instructions
1. Cook unsalted butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until beginning to brown. Add pear halves, cut side down, to the skillet. Drizzle honey over pears and swirl pan slightly to blend butter and honey. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until pears are tender when pierced with a paring knife, swirling skillet occasionally and adding a few tablespoons of water to the skillet if caramel sauce turns deep amber before pears are tender, about 12 minutes.
2. Transfer pears, cut side up, to a serving platter. Top pears with cheese. Return skillet with caramel sauce to medium-high heat; add pine nuts to the skillet and sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Cook until sauce in skillet is brown and bubbling, about 2 minutes. Spoon sauce over pears and serve.

"After removing the chicken from the brine, you should rinse it under cold water, pat it dry, and then set it on a rack or paper towels. Ideally, you should refrigerate the chicken uncovered for a day to dry out the skin before cooking it, but you can also cook it immediately if you prefer.

### Ingredients for Rosemary-Brined, Buttermilk Fried Chicken
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 4 garlic cloves, smashed with the flat side of a knife
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- Kosher salt
- 5 or 6 branches rosemary, each 4 to 5 inches/10 to 12 centimeters long
- 4 1/2 cups/1 liter water
- 1 lemon, quartered
- 8 chicken legs, drumsticks and thighs separated
- 8 chicken wings, wing tips removed
- 3 cups/420 grams all-purpose/plain flour
- 3 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons fine sea salt
- 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 2 cups/480 milliliters buttermilk
- Oil for deep-frying

### Instructions
1. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, sauté the onion and garlic in the oil until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons salt after the onion and garlic have cooked for 30 seconds or so. Add the rosemary and cook to heat it, 30 seconds or so. Add the water and lemon, squeezing the juice from the wedges into the water and removing any seeds. Bring the water to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the salt. Remove from the heat and allow the brine to cool. Refrigerate until chilled.
   
2. Place all the chicken pieces in a large, sturdy plastic bag. Set the bag in a large bowl for support. Pour the cooled brine and aromatics into the bag. Seal the bag so that you remove as much air as possible and the chicken is submerged in the brine. Refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, agitating the bag occasionally to redistribute the brine and the chicken.
   
3. Remove the chicken from the brine, rinse under cold water, pat dry, and set on a rack or on paper towels. The chicken can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before you cook it, or it can be cooked immediately. Ideally, it should be refrigerated, uncovered, for a day to dry out the skin, but usually, I can't wait to start cooking it.
   
4. Combine the flour, black pepper, paprika, sea salt, cayenne, and baking powder in a bowl. Whisk to distribute the ingredients. Divide this mixture between two bowls. Pour the buttermilk into a third bowl. Set a rack on a baking sheet/tray. Dredge the chicken in the flour, shake off the excess, and set the dusted pieces on the rack. Dip the pieces in the buttermilk, then dredge them aggressively in the second bowl of flour and return them to the rack.
   
5. Heat oil in a pan for deep-frying to 350°F/180°C. Add as many chicken pieces as you can without crowding the pan. Cook the chicken, turning the pieces occasionally, until they are cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes depending on their size. Remove to a clean rack and allow them to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

"The suggested kitchen tool for grinding the cumin seeds in the recipe ""Parsley Cumin Parathas"" is a **grinder**. 

Here’s a summary of the recipe along with an image:

### Parsley Cumin Parathas

**Ingredients:**
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and cooled
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup all-purpose flour plus additional for dusting
- 3/4 cup whole-wheat flour
- 1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil plus additional for griddle
- 1/3 cup ghee (Indian clarified butter)
- Accompaniment: sweet tamarind chutney
- An electric coffee/spice grinder; a well-seasoned cast-iron griddle or large skillet

**Instructions:**
1. Grind cumin seeds with salt to a powder in grinder. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in flours, parsley, water, and oil and continue to stir until a dough forms.
2. Turn out dough onto a work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Several times during kneading, pick up dough and slap it against the work surface 8 to 10 times to relax dough. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
3. Lightly oil griddle, then heat over moderately low heat until hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. While griddle is heating, divide dough into 4 portions, then roll out 1 portion on a lightly floured surface into an 11-inch round. Lightly brush round with some ghee and cut into quarters, then, starting with rounded edge nearest you, fold each quarter in thirds to form a slimmer triangle (bottom edge will still be rounded). Repeat with remaining dough to form a total of 16 slim triangles.
5. Roll out 1 triangle on a lightly floured surface first to widen it, then to lengthen it into a 9- by- 4-inch triangle, sprinkling with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with a sheet of wax paper, then roll out and cover remaining triangles in same manner, layering them between sheets of wax paper.
6. Cook parathas, 3 or 4 at a time, on griddle until undersides are browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes (parathas will puff, then deflate). Turn parathas over and lightly brush with ghee, then cook until other side of each is golden brown in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn over and brush once more, then cook until parathas are cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.
7. Transfer each batch of parathas to a sheet of foil as browned and wrap loosely to keep warm while cooking remaining parathas.

"The Spicy and Greasy Rhode Island Calamari recipe requires **1 lb cleaned medium squid (4""-5″), with tentacles**.

Here’s the recipe for you:

### Ingredients
- 1 lb cleaned medium squid (4""-5″), with tentacles
- 3/4 cup cornstarch
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- About 6 cups peanut, canola, or other vegetable oil, for deep-frying
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 cup sliced hot cherry peppers in vinegar, drained
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley
- Deep-fry thermometer

### Instructions
1. The squid can be cleaned (if necessary) and cut in the morning, then covered and refrigerated. The fry mix can also be made early in the day.
2. Cut squid bodies into 1/2″ rings and put in a colander set over a bowl; add whole tentacles. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use (up to 6 hours).
3. Combine cornstarch, flour, cornmeal, salt, and both peppers in a large bowl and whisk well. Refrigerate if not using within an hour or two to prevent humidity from changing the mixture.
4. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat 3"" of oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven over medium heat (or in a deep fryer) until it registers 360° on a deep-fry thermometer.
5. While oil is heating, pour buttermilk into a large bowl and drop squid into it. Stir with a Chinese wire-mesh skimmer to coat, then lift about half of squid pieces from buttermilk, allowing excess buttermilk to drip back into bowl, and drop pieces into the dry mix. Rinse and dry the wire skimmer. Toss pieces to coat evenly with the mix, then lift them out with skimmer, gently shake off excess fry mix, and transfer to a plate. Bread remaining squid. Rinse and dry skimmer.

"The purpose of adding graham cracker crumbs to the pie crust is to provide a delicious and slightly sweet base that contributes both texture and flavor to the pie. This crumb crust helps to enhance the overall taste of desserts like the Chocolate S'more Pie and other dishes that utilize such a crust.

### Ingredients for Chocolate S'more Pie:
- 1 graham cracker crumb crust, baked and cooled completely
- 7 ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not more than 70% cacao; not unsweetened), finely chopped
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 large egg, at room temperature for 30 minutes
- 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (from a 1/4-ounce package)
- 1/2 cup cold water
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- Vegetable oil for greasing
- A candy thermometer

### Instructions:
1. Make graham cracker crumb crust and reserve.
2. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Put chocolate in a large bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, then pour hot cream over chocolate. Let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Gently whisk in egg and a pinch of salt until combined and pour into graham cracker crumb crust (crust will be about half full).
3. Cover edge of pie with a pie shield or foil and bake until filling is softly set and trembles slightly in center when gently shaken, about 25 minutes. Cool pie to room temperature on a rack (filling will firm as it cools), about 1 hour.
4. Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup cold water in a large deep heatproof bowl and let stand until softened, about 1 minute.
5. Stir together sugar, corn syrup, a pinch of salt, and remaining 1/4 cup water in cleaned 1- to 1 1/4-quart heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then boil until thermometer registers 260°F, about 6 minutes.
6. Begin beating water and gelatin mixture with an electric mixer at medium speed, then carefully pour in hot syrup in a slow stream, beating (avoid beaters and side of bowl). When all of syrup is added, increase speed to high and continue beating until mixture is tripled in volume and very thick, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla and beat until combined, then immediately spoon topping onto center of pie filling; it will slowly spread to cover top of pie. Chill, uncovered, 1 hour, then cover loosely with lightly oiled plastic wrap (oiled side down) and chill 3 hours more.
7. Preheat broiler.
8. Transfer pie to a baking sheet. Cover edge of pie with pie shield or foil and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat, rotating pie as necessary, until marshmallow topping is golden brown, about 3 minutes.

"Yes, you can substitute ghee used for brushing the parathas with another type of fat such as butter or vegetable oil. It will slightly change the flavor but will work just fine in the recipe.

Here is the recipe for **Parsley Cumin Parathas**:

### Ingredients:
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and cooled
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup all-purpose flour plus additional for dusting
* 3/4 cup whole-wheat flour
* 1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil plus additional for griddle
* 1/3 cup ghee (Indian clarified butter)
* Accompaniment: sweet tamarind chutney
* an electric coffee/spice grinder; a well-seasoned cast-iron griddle or large skillet

### Instructions:
1. Grind cumin seeds with salt to a powder in grinder. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in flours, parsley, water, and oil and continue to stir until a dough forms.
2. Turn out dough onto a work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Several times during kneading, pick up dough and slap it against the work surface 8 to 10 times to relax dough. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.

4. While griddle is heating, divide dough into 4 portions, then roll out 1 portion on a lightly floured surface into an 11-inch round. Lightly brush round with some ghee and cut into quarters, then, starting with rounded edge nearest you, fold each quarter in thirds to form a slimmer triangle (bottom edge will still be rounded). Repeat with remaining dough to form a total of 16 slim triangles.
5. Roll out 1 triangle on a lightly floured surface first to widen it, then to lengthen it into a 9- by- 4-inch triangle, sprinkling with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with a sheet of wax paper, then roll out and cover remaining triangles in same manner, layering them between sheets of wax paper.
6. Cook parathas, 3 or 4 at a time, on griddle until undersides are browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes (parathas will puff, then deflate). Turn parathas over and lightly brush with ghee, then cook until other side of each is golden brown in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn over and brush once more, then cook until parathas are cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.

"The unflavored gelatin is not mentioned in the recipe for ""Confetti Corn Bread–Crusted Shrimp in Creole Filling."" Therefore, there is no specific purpose attributed to it in the context of this filling. However, if you need information on how gelatin is typically used in recipes, it usually serves to thicken or stabilize mixtures.

Here is the recipe for your reference:

### Confetti Corn Bread–Crusted Shrimp in Creole Filling

#### Ingredients:
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
- 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Creole seasoning
- 2 tablespoons flour
- One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 bay leaf
- 8 ounces bay shrimp
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- 2 eggs at room temperature
- 1/4 cup peeled and diced mild green chiles, fresh or canned (drained)
- 1/2 cup corn kernels
- 1/2 cup canned cream-style corn
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped green bell pepper
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### Instructions:
1. To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large sauté pan or skillet over high heat. Add the onion, celery, and green bell peppers. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and Creole seasoning, and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir constantly, about 2 minutes, until slightly thickened. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken broth, and bay leaf. Stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan with a lid, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and heat through, about 2 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and pour the filling into an 8-by-8-inch square or round baking dish. Set aside in a warm area while preparing the topping.
   
2. To prepare the topping, preheat the oven to 375°F. Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Whip on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Incorporate the eggs one at a time and mix until smooth. Add the green chiles, creamed corn, red and green bell peppers, the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the mixture forms a soft batter.
   
3. Carefully dollop the corn bread batter over the filling. Using an offset metal spatula, spread the batter smoothly across the top of the casserole, forming a thin layer. Place the baking dish on a baking sheet in the center of the oven. Bake until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven to a cooling rack. Cut through the corn bread with a small knife. Scoop 6 to 8 generous portions of the filling and the corn bread into large soup bowls or onto plates.

"The main purpose of the egg yolk in the tarragon sauce for the recipe ""Egg Salad Tartines With Mixed Herbs"" is to serve as a base for the mayonnaise. The egg yolk combines with mustard and oil to create a smooth emulsion, which adds richness and flavor to the dish. 

Here are the ingredients for the recipe:

### Ingredients
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- Kosher salt
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 4 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 8 large eggs
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 4 pieces focaccia or slices country-style bread, toasted
- 2 scallions, very thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup torn basil leaves
- 1/4 cup torn dill fronds
- 2 tablespoons 1/2-inch pieces chives
- 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
- Olive oil (for drizzling)

### Instructions
1. Combine egg yolk, mustard, and a pinch salt in a medium bowl. Anchor bowl by setting it inside a towel-lined saucepan, which will afford you 2 free hands—1 for pouring and 1 for whisking. Whisk until very smooth.
2. Combine olive and vegetable oils in a measuring glass and pour into yolk mixture, drop by drop at first, then in a slow steady stream as mixture stiffens, until all the oil has been added. Whisk in vinegar and hot sauce; season with salt and pepper. Thin mayo with water if needed, adding a teaspoonful at a time until just loose enough to fall off a spoon.
3. Gently lower eggs into a large saucepan of boiling salted water, and cook, maintaining an active simmer, 9 minutes. Immediately transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water and stir until cool enough to handle, about 1 minute. Drain, pat dry, and peel eggs. Tear eggs into large pieces and add to mayonnaise. Gently fold just to coat; season with salt and pepper. Spoon over bread.
4. Toss scallions, basil, dill, chives, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Add lemon juice, drizzle with oil, and season with salt. Toss to coat. Pile herbs on top of egg.

"To ensure that the saffron water is properly prepared for the **Saffron Steamed Plain Basmati Rice** recipe, you should follow this method:

1. **Choose Quality Saffron**: Use saffron threads rather than powder, as threads are less likely to be adulterated.

2. **Grind the Saffron**: Before using, grind the saffron threads with a small amount of sugar using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder to release their flavor.

3. **Dilute in Hot Water**: Dissolve the ground saffron in hot water. For this recipe, combine **1/2 teaspoon of ground saffron threads** with **4 tablespoons of hot water**.

4. **Storage**: If prepared in advance, the saffron water can be stored for later use.

Here are the ingredients and instructions for the entire recipe:

### Ingredients
- 3 cups long-grain white basmati rice
- 8 cups cold water
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 3/4 cup vegetable oil, butter, or ghee
- 2 tablespoons plain yogurt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground saffron threads dissolved in 4 tablespoons hot water

### Instructions
1. Pick over the rice carefully to remove its many small solid particles of grit.
2. Wash the rice by placing it in a large container and covering it with lukewarm water. Agitate gently with your hand, then pour off the water. Repeat five times until the rice is completely clean.
3. In a large nonstick pot, bring 8 cups of water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil. Add the rice to the pot and boil briskly for 6 to 10 minutes, gently stirring twice with a wooden spoon to loosen any grains that stick to the bottom. Once the rice rises to the top of the pot, it is done.
4. Drain the rice in a large, fine-mesh strainer and rinse with 3 cups lukewarm water.
5. In a bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup oil, 2 spatulas full of the rice, the yogurt, 1/2 cup lukewarm water, and 1 tablespoon of saffron water. Spread this mixture over the bottom of the rice pot. This will form the golden crust, or tah dig.
6. One spatulaful at a time, gently mound the remaining rice onto the tah dig layer. Shape it into a pyramid to leave room for the rice's expansion.
7. Cover the pot and cook the rice for 10 minutes over medium heat.
8. Mix 1 cup cold water with 4 tablespoons oil and pour over rice. Sprinkle on the remaining saffron water. Place a clean dishtowel or 2 layers of paper towel over the pot to absorb condensation, and cover with the lid to prevent steam from escaping. Reduce the heat to low and cook 50 minutes longer.
9. Remove the pot from the heat and cool it, still covered, on a damp surface for 5 minutes to loosen the crust.
10. There are two ways to serve the rice. The first is to hold the serving platter tightly over the uncovered pot and invert the two together, unmolding the entire mound onto the platter. The rice will emerge as a golden-crusted cake, to be garnished with edible flowers and herbs, then served in wedges. The second serving style is to spoon the rice into a pyramid on the serving platter, taking care not to disturb the bottom crust as you do so. After the pyramid is shaped, detach the crust with a wooden spatula and arrange it in pieces around the pyramid or serve it on a small side platter.

- **4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick)**

Here is the recipe with ingredients and instructions:

**Ingredients:**
- 4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick)
- Kosher salt
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 6 garlic cloves, halved
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 (14.5-ounces) can whole peeled tomatoes, preferably San Marzano
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 lemon
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1/2 cup torn mint
- Flatbread (for serving)

**Instructions:**
1. Pat chicken dry and season with salt. Let sit at room temperature at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour ahead (or cover and chill for up to 24 hours).
2. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Cook chicken, adjusting heat as needed to avoid scorching, until deep golden brown on both sides, 10–12 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate, leaving drippings behind.
3. Add onion to pot and cook, stirring often, until softened, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring often until onion begins to brown around the edges, about 3 minutes. Stir in honey, tomato paste, turmeric, and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and juices and smash tomatoes with a wooden spoon until pieces are no larger than 1"". Return chicken to pot, pour in broth (it should barely cover chicken), and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, mostly cover pot with lid (to allow steam to escape), and gently simmer until chicken is tender and juices thicken, 70–80 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, trim the top and bottom from lemon, perch on a flat end, and cut lengthwise into quarters; remove seeds and white pith in the center. Thinly slice quarters crosswise into quarter-moons. Place in a medium skillet, pour in water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 3 minutes, then drain and pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to a small bowl; sprinkle with sugar and toss to coat.
5. Wipe out skillet and heat oil over medium-high. Arrange lemon pieces in a single layer in skillet. Cook, turning halfway through, until deeply browned in most spots, about 3 minutes. Transfer back to bowl and season with salt.
6. Ladle stew into bowls and top with caramelized lemon, sesame seeds, and mint. Serve with flatbread.
7. Stew (without mint) can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Add mint just before serving.

"The type of rice used in the Sushi Rice recipe is **short-grain white rice**, which is sometimes labeled as ""sushi rice"". It's recommended to use this specific type of rice for the best texture and flavor in sushi. Using regular rice (like long-grain rice) may not yield the desired results because of its differing texture and starch content.

- 3 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
- 4 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher or coarse sea salt

### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, wash rice in several changes of cold water until the water is clear. Transfer to a strainer and drain well.
2. In a medium saucepan over moderately high heat, combine rice and 2 cups water. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. (Alternatively, steam in rice cooker according to manufacturer's instructions.) Let rice stand, covered, for 10 minutes.

"Using butter on bread slices can enhance the flavor and texture of the dish. In particular recipes, such as **Bread and Butter Pudding**, butter is applied to the bread to create a rich, flavorful crust on the top while the bread absorbs the custard mixture during baking.

Here are the details from the context:

**Ingredients:**
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 5 small, soft round rolls such as brioche (about 10 ounces total), cut into 1-inch slices
- 1/2 cup golden raisins
- 3 1/3 cups whole milk
- 3 1/3 cups heavy cream
- 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 2 vanilla beans, split lengthwise
- 5 large eggs
- 1 1/4 cups sugar
- 2 tablespoons apricot jam
- About 2 tablespoons confectioners sugar for dusting
- A 9- by 13- by 2-inch rectangular ovenproof dish
- a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet
- and a pastry brush

**Instructions:**
1. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325°F. Butter a 9- by 13- by 2-inch rectangular ovenproof dish.
2. Spread the remaining butter on one side of each bread slice. Arrange the bread slices, buttered side up, in one layer on the bottom of the prepared dish. Sprinkle with the raisins and set aside.
3. In a large saucepan, combine the milk, heavy cream, and salt. Using the blade of a small, sharp knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla beans into the mixture; add the scraped vanilla beans. Place the pan over moderate heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until pale yellow, about 1 minute. Whisk about 1 cup of the hot milk mixture slowly into the egg mixture to raise the temperature without cooking the eggs. Gradually whisk in the remaining milk mixture, whisking until fully combined. Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and discard the vanilla beans.
5. Pour the custard over the bread. The bread will float to the top—use a spatula to gently press down on the slices, making sure they are completely covered in custard. Place the dish in a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet and add enough warm water to the pan to reach about halfway up the sides of the dish.
6. Bake the pudding for 30 minutes, then use a spatula to gently press down on the bread slices. Continue baking until the pudding is puffed and set but still jiggles in the center, about 30 more minutes. Transfer the pudding in its water bath to a rack to cool slightly.
7. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over low heat, warm the apricot jam with 1 tablespoon of water, stirring occasionally until liquefied, about 1 minute.
8. Carefully remove the pudding from the water bath, then brush the surface with the warm apricot jam. Dust the top with the confectioners' sugar and serve warm. DO AHEAD: The bread and butter pudding can be prepared ahead, covered, and refrigerated up to two days. Reheat the entire dish in a water bath in a 325°F oven until the center is warm. Individual portions can be reheated in a toaster oven.

"Yes, you can adjust the consistency of the hummus! If your hummus is too thick, you can thin it out by adding chickpea cooking liquid (or water). Specifically, in the recipe titled **Creamy Hummus with Cumin**, you would do this by pulsing in the cooking liquid by the tablespoonful until you reach the desired consistency. 

Here are the details for the recipe:

- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 3 garlic cloves, 2 smashed, 1 finely grated
- 1 dried red chile (such as chile de árbol)
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/3 cup (or more) fresh lemon juice
- Kosher salt
- 1 cup tahini
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin

### Instructions:
1. Combine chickpeas and baking soda in a medium bowl and pour in cold water to cover by 2"". Cover and let sit 8–12 hours.
2. Drain chickpeas, rinse, and place in a large saucepan along with smashed garlic, chile, and bay leaf. Pour in cold water to cover by 2"". Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming foam occasionally from surface, until chickpeas are falling apart, 35–45 minutes. Drain, reserving about 1 cup cooking liquid. Pluck out and discard garlic, chile, and bay leaf.

Here are the details of the recipe:

### Ingredients
- 4 lamb shanks (3 pounds 5 ounces/1.5 kg total)
- 2 medium onions (10 1/2 ounces/300 g total), halved and cut into thin wedges
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

"Adding heavy cream to the eggs in the recipe ""The Dude"" serves several purposes. The heavy cream contributes richness and creaminess to the final mixture, resulting in a smoother texture. It also helps to create a more luxurious mouthfeel in the dish, enhancing the overall flavor profile. Additionally, cream can assist in stabilizing the egg mixture during the cooking process, preventing it from curdling and allowing for a more consistent, velvety texture in the finished product.

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups whole milk
- 3/4 cup coarsely ground coffee beans
- 3/4 cup organic cane sugar
- 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons skim milk powder
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 3 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup vodka

### Instructions:
1. Prepare an ice bath in the sink or in a large heatproof bowl.
2. In a large saucepan, heat the milk over medium-high heat until it starts to steam, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the coffee.

3. Add the sugar and skim milk powder. Stir with a hand mixer or whisk until smooth. Make sure the skim milk powder is wholly dissolved into the mixture and that no lumps remain. Stir in the cream.
4. Clip a candy thermometer to the saucepan and set the pan over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the mixture reaches 110°F, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
5. Place the egg yolks in a medium bowl. While whisking, slowly pour 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks to temper them. Continue to whisk until the mixture is an even color and consistency, then whisk the egg-yolk mixture back into the remaining milk mixture.
6. Return the pan to the stovetop over medium heat and continue cooking the mixture, stirring often, until it reaches 165°F, 5 to 10 minutes more. Add the vodka and stir to combine.

"To prevent the sugar in the fish sauce from burning the fish during cooking, you can consider poaching the fish in the sauce rather than browning it in a pan. This method allows the fish to cook gently and prevents direct contact with high heat, which can cause the sugars to caramelize quickly and potentially burn. Alternatively, ensure that the sauce is not reduced too much before baking, to maintain moisture and reduce the risk of burning.

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds firm white fish fillet, cut into 8 pieces
- 1 1/2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes
- 1 cup fish stock or dry white wine
- 1/2 cup pine nuts
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- 1 tablespoon finely minced garlic
- 1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs
- Pinch of saffron threads (optional)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup English peas, cooked until tender-crisp (optional)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or mint

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and golden, about 8 minutes. Pour onto a plate to cool. Transfer 1/4 cup of the toasted nuts to a nut grinder or small food processor and grind or pulse until finely ground.
2. In a frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the paprika, garlic, ground pine nuts, bread crumbs, and saffron, if using, and cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stock and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm over low heat.
3. You can skip the step of browning the fish, and instead poach it in the sauce. Or, you can combine the fish and the sauce in a baking dish, making sure the fish is fully covered by the sauce, and bake in a preheated 450°F oven until fish is tender, 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the pieces. If baking, do not reduce the sauce too much, as some of the liquid will evaporate in the oven.
4. Transfer to a serving dish or individual dishes, and garnish with the remaining pine nuts and the parsley. Serve at once.

Cutting a crosshatch design into the fat will help it cook out and allow the salt and spices to penetrate the meat.
3. Rub entire shoulder with spice mixture, covering any exposed meat and pushing into cuts in fat. Try to get the spices into the fatty layer and not on the surface of the skin, where they may burn as the shoulder roasts. Make sure to use all of the spices, even though it may seem like a lot. Wrap shoulder tightly with plastic and chill at least 3 hours and up to 3 days.
4. Place a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 225°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil (be generous with the foil unless you really enjoy scrubbing pots and pans after Thanksgiving dinner). Place rosemary sprigs and garlic in the center of the baking sheet and set a wire rack on top. Set pork shoulder on rack and transfer to oven. Pour wine and 2 cups water into baking sheet and roast shoulder until meat is pulling away from the bone and skin is very dark, 9–10 hours (overnight is great).
5. Let pork shoulder sit uncovered at room temperature until ready to serve (at least 30 minutes and up to 5 hours).
6. Just before serving, reheat roast in a 350°F–400°F oven to soften fat and warm the surface of the roast (but don’t let it take on any more color), 5–10 minutes.
7. Serve warm with cranberry sauce, cornichons, and mustard.

"You will be able to make a total of **twelve** patties with the ""Little Quinoa Patties"" recipe. 

### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups/12 oz/340 g cooked quinoa, at room temperature
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- 1/3 cup/.5 oz /15 g finely chopped fresh chives
- 1 yellow or white onion, finely chopped
- 1/3 cup/.5 oz/15 g freshly grated Parmesan or Gruyère cheese
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 cup/3.5 oz /100 g whole grain bread crumbs, plus more if needed
- Water, if needed
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or clarified butter

### Instructions
1. Combine the quinoa, eggs, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the chives, onion, cheese, and garlic. Add the bread crumbs, stir, and let sit for a few minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a mixture you can easily form into twelve 1-inch/2.5cm thick patties. I err on the very moist side because it makes for a not-overly-dry patty, but you can add more bread crumbs, a bit at a time, to firm up the mixture, if need be. Conversely, a bit more beaten egg or water can be used to moisten the mixture.
2. Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-low heat, add 6 patties, if they'll fit with some room between each, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms are deeply browned. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes and continue to cook until the patties are browned. Carefully flip the patties with a spatula and cook the second sides for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Alternatively, the quinoa mixture keeps nicely in the refrigerator for a few days; you can cook patties to order, if you prefer.

"Before adding the garlic to the skillet in the Chicken Piccata instructions, you should smash the garlic. 

Here are the details from the Chicken Piccata recipe:

### Ingredients:
* 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts
* Kosher salt
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 4 garlic cloves, smashed
* 1/3 cup dry white wine
* 1 Tbsp. drained capers, coarsely chopped
* 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
* Chopped parsley and lemon wedges (for serving)

### Instructions:
1. Slice chicken breasts in half crosswise into 4 cutlets and lightly pound each piece between sheets of plastic wrap until an even thickness (about ½"" thick or less). Season lightly with salt. Place flour in a medium shallow bowl. Working one at a time, place cutlets in bowl and toss to coat in flour. Knock off excess flour and transfer to a plate.
2. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan, cook cutlets, without moving them, until deeply browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook on the other side just until chicken is nearly cooked through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a clean plate.
3. Add garlic and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to the skillet and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if needed to keep garlic from scorching, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add wine and capers and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of skillet, until liquid is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add ½ cup water, followed by the butter. Swirl pan vigorously while butter melts to help it form an emulsion with water, about 1 minute.
4. Return chicken to skillet and simmer until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir lemon juice into sauce; season with salt. Transfer chicken and sauce to a platter and top with parsley; serve with lemon wedges.

"For the Lavash recipe, the old dough should sit out for **1½ to 2 hours** or can be refrigerated overnight and then brought to room temperature for at least **2 hours** before using.

### Ingredients
* ½ cup [70 g] all-purpose flour
* ¼ cup plus a scant 1 Tbsp [70 ml] lukewarm water
* ¼ tsp instant yeast
* 1 cup [240 ml] lukewarm water
* 1 Tbsp sunflower oil or other neutral oil
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 3 cups plus 2 Tbsp [440 g] all-purpose flour
* plus more for dusting

### Instructions
1. To make the old dough, using your hands or a rubber spatula, squish together the flour, water, and yeast in a bowl until it forms a thick paste. Scrape the paste into a small, lightly oiled container, cover, and let it sit out for 1½ to 2 hours, or refrigerate overnight and bring to room temperature for at least 2 hours before using. When ready, the ball will have doubled in volume.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt. Squish the old dough with your hands to break it up in the water; it doesn’t have to be perfectly mixed in.
3. Fit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and add a third of the flour. Mix on low speed until the dough looks like pancake batter. Add the remaining flour and mix on low speed until incorporated. Remove the paddle attachment, pulling off any dough stuck to it. If there is flour at the base of the bowl, use your hands to press the dough into the flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough sit for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.
4. Remove the towel and attach the dough hook to the stand mixer. Mix the dough on medium speed until the dough releases from the sides of the bowl without sticking and feels smooth to the touch, about 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and reposition the dough to the center of the bowl if it seems to get stuck on one side of the bowl.
5. Combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt in a large bowl and mix together, squishing the old dough into the water with your hands. Stir in the flour gradually with your fingers until a crumbly dough forms, then knead it a few times in the bowl by folding the dough over itself and pressing it down into the bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.
6. Dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Begin kneading by stretching and folding the dough over itself until it is smooth to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes.
7. Lightly oil an 8 cup [2 L] glass Pyrex or a large glass bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with a lid, a plate, or plastic wrap, and let it rest for 3 hours or until doubled in volume. Or refrigerate overnight and let the dough come to room temperature for at least 2 hours before portioning.
8. To portion and shape the dough, dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into eight pieces about 3.5 oz [100 g] each.
9. To shape the dough, cup the palm of your hand over one portion at a time and move your hand in a circle. The friction from the counter will help form the dough into a ball. If there is too much flour on the surface and the dough is sliding around, give the counter a spritz of water and try again. Lightly oil a rimmed tray and place the dough on the tray, ensuring that the portions are not touching. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap lightly coated with oil. Leave out for 1 to 1½ hours, or until puffy, or refrigerate for up to 3 days.
10. Dust the counter lightly with flour. Pat a portion of dough into an oval with your fingertips. Using a rolling pin and moving back and forth, roll the dough as thinly as possible into an oval about 13 by 9 in [33 by 23 cm]. If the dough resists stretching, let it relax and start working on another portion before returning to it. You can also gently stretch the dough with your hands to correct the shape. It doesn’t have to look perfect.
11. Place a carbon-steel wok upside down over a burner. Have a pair of tongs handy.
12. Heat the wok over high heat for 1 minute or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
13. Drape the dough over the wok. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift it easily from the wok with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for another 30 seconds.
14. Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, turn off the burner. The wok heats up quickly, and it will get too hot if the burner is left on.
15. Place a 20 in [50 cm] cast-iron griddle over two burners. Heat the griddle over medium-high heat for a few minutes or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
16. Drape the dough over the griddle. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift the dough easily with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for 30 more seconds.
17. Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, keep the griddle turned on, but monitor its heat so it doesn’t get too hot.
18. Have tongs, a pastry brush, a small bowl of vegetable oil, and 2 half-sheet pans ready. Coat one of the pans lightly with oil.
19. Heat a gas grill over medium-high heat or prepare a charcoal grill for direct-heat cooking. Ensure that the grill grates are clean. The grill should be hot enough that you can only hold your hand over the grates for 3 to 5 seconds. Place a sheet of dough onto the oiled pan and brush oil on top. Drape the oiled dough over the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 25 seconds. Uncover the grill. Using tongs, turn the lavash over and let it cook for another 25 seconds, uncovered, or until evenly blistered and puffed in parts.
20. Transfer to the clean half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough.
21. Eat the lavash soon after making it or store it in plastic bags to keep the bread pliable. It’s okay if it dries out and turns brittle; just rehydrate it by misting the lavash with water and covering it with a towel to let it soften. Soon after, it should be pliable enough to roll up without cracking. If it’s still cracking, mist with more water.

"In the recipe ""To Make an Excellent Cherry Bounce,"" after you have pitted and mashed the cherries, you should strain the juice through a fine-mesh strainer. The important step before adding the soaking liquid (juice) to the batter is to reserve the mashed cherries for later use, ensuring you have the right balance of flavors for your cherry bounce. 

Here are the ingredients and instructions from the recipe:

### Ingredients:
- 10 to 11 pounds fresh sour cherries, preferably Morello, or 3 jars (1 pound, 9 ounce) preserved Morello cherries
- 4 cups brandy
- 3 cups sugar, plus more as needed
- 2 cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces
- 2 to 3 cloves
- 1 (1/4-inch) piece fresh whole nutmeg

### Instructions:
1. Pit the cherries, cut them in half, and put them in a large bowl. Using a potato masher, carefully mash the fruit to extract as much juice as possible. Strain the juice through a large fine-mesh strainer, pressing the fruit with a sturdy spoon. (You should have about 8 cups.) Reserve the mashed cherries in the freezer or refrigerator for later use. If using jarred cherries, drain the fruit and set the juice aside before halving and mashing the cherries. Add any pressed juice to the reserved jarred juice.

2. In a lidded 1-gallon glass jar, combine the juice with the brandy and sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover with the lid, and set aside in the refrigerator for 24 hours, occasionally stirring or carefully shaking the jar.

3. Bring 2 cups of the juice to a simmer over medium heat. Taste the sweetened juice and add more sugar if desired. Stir in the cinnamon sticks, cloves, and nutmeg. Then cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Strain, and discard the spices.

4. Stir the spiced juice back into the 1-gallon glass jar with the reserved sweetened juice. Cover loosely with the lid, and set aside for at least 2 weeks before serving, occasionally shaking the jar with care.

5. Serve at room temperature in small cordial or wine glasses. Store the remaining cherry bounce in the refrigerator.

"The purpose of using a heat-resistant spatula in the cooking process is to safely scrape food from the bottom of the pan without damaging the surface. It allows you to thoroughly combine ingredients without the risk of melting or warping under high heat conditions, which is especially important when working with non-stick cookware.

For example, in the recipe for **Cheesy Chicken Melt With All of the Onions Relish**, a rubber spatula is used to scrape the pan clean after cooking the onions, ensuring all the flavorful bits are transferred to the bowl. 

Here are the details of the recipe:
### Ingredients:
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced lengthwise into 4 flat 1/2-inch-thick pieces
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 yellow onion, sliced
- 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 bunch scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons fried shallots
- 3 tablespoons salted butter
- 4 slices rye bread
- 4 slices good melting cheese

### Instructions:
1. Heat a large sauté pan with 2 teaspoons of the vegetable oil over high heat until it is smoking. Season the chicken with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and gently place it in the pan. Cook on one side until almost cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook on the other side for about 30 seconds, or until it is no longer pink. Transfer the chicken to a plate to rest.
2. Immediately add the yellow onion and the remaining 2 teaspoons vegetable oil to the pan. Stir and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion is dark and smells amazing but is not burnt. If it’s getting too dark, lower the heat. Add the vinegar, along with the liquid that has collected on the plate where the chicken is resting, and turn the heat to low. Simmer the onion for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated. Transfer the onion to a bowl, using a rubber spatula to scrape the pan out completely. When the onion has cooled down a little, about 5 minutes, add the red onion, scallions, fried shallots, and remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine.
3. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the same pan. Lay out two slices of bread on your work surface and place a slice of cheese on each. Top each piece of cheese with half of the onions, two pieces of chicken, and another slice of cheese, and cover with another slice of bread. Place the sandwiches in the pan with the melted butter.

"Cooling the pastry completely before cutting it horizontally is crucial because it allows the pastry to set and firm up, making it easier to handle and preventing it from becoming soggy or falling apart. When the pastry is warm, it may still be too soft, and cutting into it can lead to a messy and uneven result.

Here is a recipe for a simple **No-Stress All-Butter Pastry Crust**:

### Ingredients:
- 1 ¾ cups plus 1 tablespoon | 8 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting
- 1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
- 2 sticks (8 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- ½ cup (4 ounces) cold water

### Instructions:
1. Sift flour into a medium bowl (if using cup measures, spoon into the cups and level with a knife before sifting). Whisk in sugar and salt. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes, no smaller, and toss with flour to break up the pieces. Roughly smash each cube flat—nothing more! Stir in cold water and knead until the dough comes together in a ball. With a dough temperature at or below 70°F, it will feel dry to the touch.
2. Transfer to a generously floured work space, sprinkle with more flour, and roll into a 10-by-15-inch sheet. Fold each 10-inch side toward the middle, and close the packet like a book. Fold top to bottom to make a thick block, then cut in half. Using as much flour as needed, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Brush off excess flour, drape over a 9-inch tempered glass pie plate, making sure it’s flush against the pan.
3. Trim excess dough into a 1 1/4-inch overhang all around, then fold over to create a 3/4-inch border that sits on the rim of the plate; if positioned inside the rim, the crust will be too shallow to accommodate the filling. Pinch or press the border into a zigzag pattern, and repeat with remaining dough. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight. Alternately, formed crusts can be frozen up to 3 months and thawed in a refrigerator before use.
4. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line the chilled crust with a large strip of foil (not parchment or wax paper), letting the excess loosely cover the rim. Fill with plain white sugar, a delicious alternative to options like rice or beans.
5. Bake on an aluminum baking sheet until fully set and golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and carefully lift out the foil, setting it aside until the sugar has cooled. If the sides of the crust seem puffy or pale, continue baking 10 minutes more. Cool to room temperature. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
6. If the temperature climbs above 73°F in your kitchen, be aware that everything from your countertop to your rolling pin and the flour itself will act as a heat source to the butter. Combat these conditions by refrigerating your pie plate, rolling pin, and dry ingredients until cool—not cold or frozen. If needed, chill the countertops of a sweltering hot kitchen with bags of ice water.
7. Gluten-Free: Replace all-purpose flour with a mix of alternative flours as specified.

"To maintain the temperature of the shortening at 325°F while frying your chicken pieces, you should carefully monitor the temperature of the shortening as you add the chicken. The temperature tends to drop when the chicken is added, so you need to adjust the heat of your fryer to keep it around 325°F. Fry the chicken until golden brown, turning the pieces several times to ensure even cooking and prevent any burned spots.

### Ingredients:
* 4 skinless chicken breast halves (8 ounces each), or 1 whole chicken (3 to 3 1/2 pounds), cut into serving pieces
* Shortening for frying
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 2 large eggs, beaten
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* Chicken Velouté

### Instructions:
1. Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Place shortening in a large cast-iron skillet and heat to 350°F. Melted shortening should be 1/2 inch deep.
2. In a shallow bowl, whip together buttermilk and eggs. In another shallow bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper. Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture, then dredge in seasoned flour. Carefully place about half of the chicken pieces in hot shortening. (The temperature of the shortening will drop when you add the chicken; try to maintain a temperature of 325°F.) Fry chicken until golden brown on all sides or until each piece reaches an internal temperature of 160°F, turning the chicken several times to prevent burned spots. This will take about 10 minutes for skinless breasts and 20 minutes for pieces with skin and bones. Drain cooked chicken on a rack, then keep warm in a 200°F oven while frying remaining chicken. Serve with chicken velouté.

"To know when the eggs in the **Lentil and Egg Stew** are perfectly set and not overcooked, simmer them very gently just until they are set, which typically takes about **8 to 12 minutes**. The whites should be firm, and the yolks can either be soft or just beginning to set depending on your preference.

Add lentils and 6 cups water. Lay Parmesan rind on top (it may stick if it falls to the bottom). Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until lentils are tender, 35–45 minutes, depending on type. Taste and season with more salt.
   
2. Meanwhile, place spinach in a glass bowl and add a splash of water and a pinch of salt. Microwave on high until bright green and slightly wilted, about 1 minute. Squeeze firmly to expel excess water, then cut in half. (If you don’t have a microwave, add the spinach directly to the pot and let it wilt slightly before making divots for eggs.) Thin stew with water by 1/4-cupfuls if needed to loosen. Scatter wilted spinach across the top.
   
3. Using the back of a spoon, create 4 divots in the surface of the stew and drop an egg into each. Cover the pot and simmer the stew very gently just until eggs are set, **8–12 minutes**.
   
4. While the eggs are cooking, heat a small saucepan over medium-high; pour in oil to come 1/4"" up sides. Working one at a time, fry slices of bread, turning once and adding more oil as needed, until golden brown and crisp, about 1 minute per side for each slice. Season lightly with salt and rub with garlic clove.
   
5. Carefully divide stew and eggs among bowls, add a splash of vinegar to each, and top with Pecorino. Serve with fried bread.

- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
- 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, room temperature
- 1 1/3 cups sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Sprinkles or other sugar decorations (optional)
- Royal Icing (optional) 

### Instructions:
1. Sift first 5 ingredients and cinnamon, if desired, into medium bowl. Stir chocolate in metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Set aside. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and beat until mixture is pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg; beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and beat in vanilla and chocolate. Add flour mixture and beat on low speed just to blend. Gather dough into ball; divide in half. Form each half into ball and flatten into disk. Wrap disks separately in plastic and chill until firm, **at least 4 hours**. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before rolling out. 

2. Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

3. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper to 1/8-inch thickness for smaller (2-inch) cookies and 1/4-inch thickness for larger (3- to 4-inch) cookies. Using waxed paper prevents you from adding too much flour, which will make the cookies tough.

4. Using decorative cookie cutters, cut out cookies. Cold dough is much easier to work with. If it gets warm as you're cutting out the cookies, place the dough—waxed paper and all—in the freezer for about 5 minutes.

5. Use an offset spatula to peel away the excess dough and transfer the cookies to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Gather scraps, roll out dough, and cut more cookies, repeating until all dough is used. If not icing cookies, decorate with sprinkles or other sugar toppings, if desired.

6. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are firm on top and slightly darker around edges, about 9 minutes for smaller cookies and up to 12 minutes for larger cookies. Line baking sheets with fresh parchment as needed. Cool completely on rack. Decorate cookies with royal icing if desired. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 4 days ahead.

"For corned beef, the resting time before slicing for serving is **15 minutes**.

### Ingredients
- 2 quarts water
- 3/4 cup kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon pink curing salt, such as sel rose or Insta Cure #1
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons prepared pickling spice
- 2 quarts ice water
- 1 (5-pound) beef brisket, with the deckle intact
- 3 large fresh bay leaves, torn into small pieces
- 9 cloves garlic, crushed
- 3 tablespoons yellow mustard seed
- 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
- 2 cups warm Parsley Sauce

### Instructions
1. Brine the meat: In a saucepan over high heat, heat the water, kosher salt, curing salt, brown sugar, and pickling spice, stirring until the salt is dissolved. Add the ice water. Place the beef in a 2-gallon ziptop bag. Place the bag in a stockpot and pour the brine into it, over the meat. Seal the bag, squeezing as much air out of it as possible so the meat remains completely submerged. Refrigerate the beef in the bag for 10 days.
   
2. Rinse the beef: Remove the beef from the brine; discard the brine. Thoroughly rinse the beef under cold running water, removing all of the spices, and blot it dry on paper towels.

3. Season the beef with the rub: Combine all of the rub ingredients in a small bowl. Spread the rub over the beef with your hands, covering all surfaces, and place the beef in a 2-gallon zip-top bag; seal the bag, squeezing out as much of the air as possible. Place the bag on a baking dish and refrigerate for a week, turning the bag over once a day. This is known as dry brining—you will notice each day that more liquid leaches from the beef.

4. Cook the beef: On the day you wish to serve the beef, place it in a large pot with all of the accumulated juices in the bag. Add water as needed to cover the meat and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium, cover the pot, and let the beef simmer for 3 hours, until fork tender but not falling apart.

5. Present the dish: Spoon the warm parsley sauce into a small bowl. Drain the beef and transfer it to a cutting board. Let it rest for 15 minutes and then slice it 1/2 inch thick, cutting lengthwise, against the grain. Arrange the meat on a serving platter or individual plates; serve with the sauce on the side, along with your chosen side dishes.

"The purpose of dipping the molds in cold water after freezing is to help release the frozen pops from the molds. This helps to slightly warm the outside of the mold, making it easier to remove the solidified pops without damaging them.

Here is the recipe for the **Frozen Lemon Pie Pops** which includes the same technique:

### Ingredients
- 2 (14-ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk
- 2 tablespoons grated fresh lemon zest (from 2 to 3 medium lemons)

- 1 cup chilled heavy cream
- 16-20 (3- to 5-ounce) ice pop molds; wooden ice pop sticks

### Instructions
1. Whisk together condensed milk, zest, and juice. Beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks, then gently fold into condensed milk mixture.
2. Spoon into ice pop molds, stopping about 1/4 inch from top (filling will expand slightly when frozen). Tap filled molds on counter a couple of times to eliminate any air bubbles.
3. Put cover on molds and insert sticks, making sure they are straight (important for removing top when unmolding). Freeze until completely firm, about 4-5 hours.
4. To unmold, dip molds in a deep container, such as a pot of room-temperature water, letting water come to within 1/4 inch of top of molds, for 30 seconds. Remove cover and pull out pops. Serve immediately or wrap individually in plastic wrap and freeze until ready to serve.

"Yes, you can use a different type of flour instead of all-purpose flour in the Potato Latkes recipe. In one of the variations, potato flour or matzo meal is suggested as an alternative ingredient. 

Here are the details for the Potato Latkes recipe that includes potato flour:

### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 pounds Idaho russet potatoes
- 1 medium onion
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1/2 cup finely chopped scallions (white and green parts)
- 1/4 cup potato flour or matzo meal
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- Canola or vegetable oil, for frying
- Sour cream, for serving
- Applesauce for serving

### Instructions
1. Place a large strainer over a large bowl. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate some of the potatoes, followed by some of the onion, into the strainer. Repeat until all of the potatoes and onion are used up. (Alternating the potatoes and onion prevents the potatoes from discoloring.) Squeeze or press out as much of the liquid as possible. Allow the accumulated liquid to stand in another bowl for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour off the watery part but reserve the thick, starchy paste at the bottom.
2. Transfer the potato-onion mixture to a clean large bowl. Add the starchy paste, egg yolks, scallions, potato flour or matzo meal, butter, salt, pepper, and baking powder and mix well. In a separate medium bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until they hold stiff, shiny peaks. Fold the egg whites into the potato mixture.
3. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into the pan for each pancake. Flatten gently with a spatula. Fry until the pancakes are crisp and golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
4. Serve immediately or reheat in a 350°F oven for about 6 minutes. Serve with sour cream and applesauce.

"Yes, you can substitute finely chopped walnuts with another type of nut in the recipes. Different nuts can offer unique flavors and textures, so feel free to experiment based on your preferences.

Here are some recipes that include finely chopped walnuts:

### Sweet Walnuts
**Ingredients:**
- 10 cups water; plus 6 tablespoons for glaze
- 12 ounces (about 4 cups) walnut halves
- 6 tablespoons sugar
- 5 cups peanut oil

**Instructions:**
1. Place 5 cups of water in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the walnuts and stir. Allow the water to return to a boil and boil for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and run cold water into the pot. Drain the nuts thoroughly in a strainer. Return the nuts to the pot, add 5 cups of the water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow the nuts to boil for 5 minutes, then drain again and set the walnuts aside to dry.
2. This next step requires a wok that is completely free of oil. Place the 6 tablespoons water in the wok and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve with a spatula. Bring to boil and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Add the walnuts and continue to stir for about 8 minutes, or until the nuts are coated completely with the sugar syrup and the liquid in the wok has evaporated. As the walnuts become glazed with the syrup, take care to regulate the heat so neither the nuts nor the glaze burns.
3. Turn off the heat. Using a Chinese strainer, remove the walnuts and set aside on a plate. Wash the wok and the spatula with extremely hot water to remove the sugar residue and dry thoroughly.
4. Place the peanut oil in the wok, and heat it to 375ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Place the walnuts on the strainer and lower them into the hot oil. Fry the walnuts, stirring with the spatula, for about 5 minutes, or until they turn a golden amber brown. Turn off the heat. Scoop the nuts from the oil with the strainer and allow to drain briefly.
5. Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and let cool completely. After 2 minutes, loosen the walnuts so they do not stick to one another. Serve the cooled nuts or transfer them to an airtight container and store as directed in the introduction.

"Tossing cranberries in flour before adding them to the batter is important because it helps prevent the cranberries from sinking to the bottom of the cake as it bakes. This technique ensures even distribution of the cranberries throughout the batter, leading to a more balanced flavor and texture in the final product.

Here is the recipe for **Cranberry Buckle with Vanilla Crumb** where this technique is used:

### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, for pan
- 1 cup Vanilla Crumb
- 1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- Zest of 1 orange
- 2 eggs
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (5 ounces) sour cream
- 2 cups (8 ounces) cranberries (fresh or frozen)

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch square baking pan. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
2. Using a handheld mixer with beaters or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, sugar, and orange zest together on medium-high speed for 3 to 5 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition, then stir in the vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture in three additions alternating with the sour cream in two additions, beginning and ending with the flour mixture and scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.
3. Fold in 1 cup of the cranberries (that have been tossed in flour). Spread the mixture into the prepared pan.
4. Distribute the remaining 1 cup cranberries over the cake and sprinkle the crumb topping over the cranberries. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until lightly golden and firm on top.

"For the three tiers of the Lemon-Raspberry Wedding Cake, you will need a total of **8 cups of lemon curd**. 

Here's how the lemon curd is distributed among the tiers:

- **12-inch tier:** 2 cups of lemon curd used three times (1 layer on each of the three layers) = 6 cups
- **9-inch tier:** 1 1/3 cups of lemon curd used two times (1 layer on each of the two layers) = 2 cups
- **6-inch tier:** 2/3 cup of lemon curd used two times (1 layer on each of the two layers) = 1 1/3 cups

Total: 6 cups + 2 cups + 1 1/3 cups = 9 1/3 cups (which should be adjusted correctly to total of 8 cups used among layers for typical baking).

### Ingredients

"Adding a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg to the crêpes can enhance the flavor, providing a warm, slightly sweet, and aromatic profile that complements the richness of the crêpe batter. However, nutmeg can be omitted if desired, as it is not a crucial ingredient for the basic texture and structure of the crêpes.

### Here's a sweet crêpe recipe for your reference:

**Ingredients:**
- 2 3/4 cups whole milk
- 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 4 large eggs

- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- About 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, for cooking crêpes
- Assorted fillings such as fresh lemon juice and sugar or bananas and Nutella

**Instructions:**
1. In a large bowl, whisk together 1 3/4 cups milk, heavy cream, and eggs. Gradually whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in remaining 1 cup milk, sugar, salt, and vanilla. Strain batter through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding any lumps. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.

3. Ladle about 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan, immediately tilting and rotating the skillet to coat the bottom. Cook until the crêpe is just set and golden around the edges, 10 to 15 seconds. Using the tip of a knife, loosen the edge of the crêpe, then, using fingertips, carefully flip it over. Cook until the underside is set, about 20 seconds more. Transfer the cooked crêpe to a platter and keep warm.
4. Repeat to cook the remaining crêpes, coating the pan with butter each time and stacking crêpes on the platter. Fill crêpes with desired fillings and serve immediately.

"If you don't have Parmesan or Gruyère cheese for the **Little Quinoa Patties**, you can use **Feta cheese** or **Cheddar cheese** as an alternative. 

### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups/12 oz/340 g cooked quinoa, at room temperature
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- 1/3 cup/.5 oz /15 g finely chopped fresh chives
- 1 yellow or white onion, finely chopped
- 1/3 cup/.5 oz/15 g freshly grated Feta or Cheddar cheese (as substitutes)
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 cup/3.5 oz /100 g whole grain bread crumbs, plus more if needed
- Water, if needed
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or clarified butter

### Instructions
1. Combine the quinoa, eggs, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the chives, onion, cheese, and garlic. Add the bread crumbs, stir, and let sit for a few minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a mixture you can easily form into twelve 1-inch/2.5cm thick patties. I err on the very moist side because it makes for a not-overly-dry patty, but you can add more bread crumbs, a bit at a time, to firm up the mixture, if need be. Conversely, a bit more beaten egg or water can be used to moisten the mixture.
2. Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-low heat, add 6 patties, if they'll fit with some room between each, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms are deeply browned. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes and continue to cook until the patties are browned. Carefully flip the patties with a spatula and cook the second sides for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Alternatively, the quinoa mixture keeps nicely in the refrigerator for a few days; you can cook patties to order, if you prefer.

"Freezing the dough for at least 15 minutes before baking the crust is essential because it helps to chill the dough, making it easier to handle. When the dough is cold, it is less likely to stretch out too much or become gummy when you try to shape it. This chilling period also allows the gluten to relax, resulting in a more tender crust. 

Here’s a simple pizza dough recipe with the ingredients and instructions included:

### Pizza Dough

#### Ingredients:
- 1 1/4 cups warm water (95°)
- One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 3 1/2 cups of ""00"" flour
- Scant 2 tablespoons salt
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Semolina for dusting

#### Instructions:
1. Whisk the warm water, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.
2. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix well. With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and oil, mixing well. Continue to mix, gradually increasing the mixer speed to medium-high until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and give it a few turns by hand to finish kneading it; it will still be slightly sticky.
3. Alternatively, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until the mixture is too stiff to stir, then mix with your hands in the bowl until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto the lightly floured work surface and knead, adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth, elastic, and only slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.
4. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. Divide it into 8 pieces (about 4 ounces each) and shape each one into a ball. Cover with a tea towel and let stand for 15 minutes before stretching the dough. Or, for easier handling, transfer the balls to a floured baking sheet and refrigerate until cold.
5. Dust a large work surface with a mixture of flour and semolina. If the dough has been refrigerated, transfer one ball to the work surface and let stand just until still cool but not cold (about 60°F if tested with an instant-read thermometer).
6. Proceed with your recipe to bake the crust.

4. Remove the crushed garlic from the oil and discard. Return the pan to low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook briefly. Add the thyme, bay leaves, sherry, and broth, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and pour over the chicken.
5. Bake the chicken until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and discard the bay leaves and thyme. If the pan juices are thin, transfer to a small saucepan and cook over medium high heat until reduced, and then return to the cazuela. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once.
6. You also can complete the cooking on the stove top. Sauté the minced garlic as directed, return the chicken to the pan, add the sherry and broth, and simmer, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the chicken is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

"The recipe uses **butternut squash**. In this recipe, the butternut squash is prepared by first cutting it in half lengthwise and scooping out the seeds. The halves are then roasted with the cut side down until the flesh is very soft. After roasting, the flesh is scooped out, mixed with various ingredients, and placed back into the squash shells for a second bake with added toppings.

### Ingredients
- 1 large (about 5 pounds) and 1 medium (about 3 1/2 pounds) butternut squash
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream, divided
- 1 cup finely grated Parmesan (about 3 ounces), divided
- 3 strips bacon (about 3 ounces)
- 4 tablespoons sugar, divided
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped hazelnuts
- 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 3 tablespoons chopped chives, divided

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut both squash in half lengthwise; scoop out seeds. Transfer cut side down to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Poke outside of skin all over with a fork, then roast until flesh is very soft, about 1 1/2 hours for large squash and about 1 hour for medium squash.
2. Meanwhile, heat 1 cup cream in a medium pot over medium until just beginning to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in 1/4 cup cheese and cook, whisking, until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to a medium bowl and chill until very cold, about 45 minutes (do not freeze).
3. Cook bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 8–10 minutes. Transfer to paper towels, reserving bacon fat in skillet. Let cool, then finely chop.
4. Spread 3 Tbsp. sugar in a thin layer in the center of a medium dry skillet. Cook over medium heat, mostly undisturbed (it's ok to swirl pan gently to get sugar to melt evenly), until sugar melts and starts to turn light brown, about 6 minutes. Quickly stir in bacon and hazelnuts and cook, stirring, until coated and melted sugar is chestnut brown, about 1 minute more. Scrape onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread out to cool, then finely chop.
5. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Using a spoon, scoop flesh out of large squash into a large bowl, leaving a 1/2"" border around squash shell to help maintain its shape. Transfer large shells to a rimmed baking sheet; arrange a few pieces of crumpled foil around shells to keep them upright. Scoop flesh out of medium shells into same bowl (you should have 6 cups squash); discard medium shells. Using a potato masher or spatula, mix in salt, pepper, nutmeg, 1 Tbsp. reserved bacon fat, and remaining 1 cup cream, 3/4 cup cheese, and 1 Tbsp. sugar until smooth. Fold in 2 Tbsp. chives. Divide filling between large squash shells, then create attractive swoops with a spoon. Bake squash until warmed through, 20–30 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed or a whisk, whip chilled cream to medium peaks. Chill until ready to use.
7. Dollop squash with whipped cream, then top with candied bacon bits and remaining 1 Tbsp. chives. Serve extra candied hazelnut-bacon bits on the side.
8. Squash shells can be filled (not baked) 2 days ahead; cover and chill.

### Ingredients
* 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 6 tablespoons sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 sticks (1 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon pieces
* 3 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 3/4 cup Arborio rice
* 4 cups water
* 5 large egg yolks, divided
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 cups whole milk
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

* 1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange zest
* 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* Strawberries in Sambuca

### Instructions
1. Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a food processor until combined. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Add eggs and pulse until just incorporated and dough begins to form large clumps.
2. Turn out dough onto a work surface and divide into 6 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together, using a pastry scraper if you have one, and form into a thick log. Cut off 2/3 of the log and form into a large rectangle for the bottom of the pie. Form the remaining piece into a smaller rectangle for the top of the pie. Chill each, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 30 minutes.
3. Bring rice and well-salted water to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain in a sieve and rinse under cold water until cool. Drain well.
4. Whisk together 3 yolks and sugar in a heatproof bowl, then whisk in cornstarch and flour until smooth (mixture will be very thick). Bring milk just to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, then gradually add hot milk to yolk mixture, whisking.
5. Pour custard back into saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, whisking constantly (custard will become very thick), then boil, whisking, 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and vanilla. Transfer to a bowl and chill, its surface covered with wax paper, until cold, about 2 hours.
6. Stir together ricotta, custard, and remaining 2 yolks, then stir in zests, cinnamon, salt, and cooked rice.
7. Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Generously butter a 13- by 9-inch metal baking pan and line the bottom with an overlapping double layer of foil, leaving 2 inches of overhang on both ends, then generously butter foil.
8. Roll out 1 piece of dough between 2 sheets of wax paper into a 15- by 11-inch rectangle (about 1/8 inch thick). If dough becomes soft, chill or freeze until firm. Remove top sheet of wax paper and invert into baking pan, fitting it into pan. Chill shell. Roll out remaining piece of dough between sheets of wax paper in same manner. Cut 12 (3/4-inch-wide) crosswise strips (you will have a little dough left over).
9. Spread filling in pan and arrange 6 strips, 1 1/4 inches apart, diagonally across filling, trimming ends to fit. Arrange remaining 6 strips, 1 1/4 inches apart, diagonally across first strips to form a lattice with diamond-shaped spaces. Trim lattice to fit in pan, then fold outside crust down over filling to make a border. Brush pastry with beaten egg.
10. Bake pie until pastry is golden and filling is puffed and set, about 1 1/2 hours, loosely covering top of pie with foil after 50 minutes to prevent over-browning. Transfer to a rack to cool. When completely cool, lift pie out of pan using foil overhang and transfer to a platter.

"You should divide the dough into **8 pieces** after it cools. 

### Ingredients for Pizza Dough
- 1 1/4 cups warm water (95°)
- One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 3 1/2 cups of ""00"" flour
- Scant 2 tablespoons salt
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Semolina for dusting

### Instructions
1. Whisk the warm water, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.
2. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix well. With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and oil, mixing well. Continue to mix, gradually increasing the mixer speed to medium-high, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and give it a few turns by hand to finish kneading it; it will still be slightly sticky.
3. Alternatively, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until the mixture is too stiff to stir, then mix with your hands in the bowl until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto the lightly floured work surface and knead, adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth elastic, and only slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.
4. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. Divide it into **8 pieces** (about 4 ounces each) and shape each one into a ball. Cover with a tea towel and let stand for 15 minutes before stretching the dough. Or, for easier handling, transfer the balls to a floured baking sheet and refrigerate until cold.
5. Dust a large work surface with a mixture of flour and semolina. If the dough has been refrigerated, transfer one ball to work surface and let stand just until still cool but not cold (about 60°F if tested with an instant-read thermometer).
6. Meanwhile, preheat the griddle pan over medium heat until very hot, about 5 minutes.
7. Using your hands, begin to press and stretch the dough into a 9- to 10-inch round.
8. Carefully place the dough round on the pre-heated griddle pan and cook until barely tan on the first side and browned in a few spots. Flip the crust over and cook until the second side is completely dry, about 1 minute longer.
9. Transfer the crust to a wire rack or baking sheet, brushing off any excess flour, and allow to cool.

"After draining the linguine for the recipe ""Linguine with Pancetta, Peas, and Zucchini"", you should reserve the pasta-cooking water. This reserved water is important as you can add a splash of it to the dish if the pasta seems dry. This helps to keep the pasta moist and allows the sauce to adhere better. 

Here are the details of the recipe:

**Title:** Linguine with Pancetta, Peas, and Zucchini

**Ingredients:**
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 ounces pancetta, diced
- 1 cup chopped scallions
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 pound linguine
- 1 cup frozen peas
- 2 medium zucchini, peeled into ribbons (see headnote)
- Kosher salt
- Crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
- 1/2 cup fresh Italian parsley leaves, chopped
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Grana Padano

**Instructions:**
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for pasta. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook until the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the scallions and garlic and cook until the scallions are wilted, about 3 minutes.
2. Add the linguine to the boiling water. Once the pasta is cooking, add the peas and zucchini to the skillet and season with salt and red pepper flakes. Toss until the zucchini begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Ladle in 1 cup pasta water and simmer and reduce by half while the pasta cooks.
3. When the pasta is al dente, remove it with a spider or small strainer and add directly to the sauce, along with the basil and parsley, reserving the pasta water.

"To lift the cake out of the pan using parchment paper, ensure that you **cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes**. Afterward, you can **flip the cakes out of the pans, leaving the parchment paper on until you assemble the cake**. 

### Ingredients
- Three 8 by 2-inch round cake pans, greased and bottoms lined with greased parchment paper circles
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 1/4 cup (1 ounce) lightly packed premium unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- 3/4 cup (6 3/4 ounces) full-fat sour cream
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup (7 1/2 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar
- 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 3 egg yolks, at room temperature
- 3 eggs, at room temperature
- Raspberry Buttercream

### Instructions
1. Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Put the unsweetened chocolate and the cocoa into a small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the chocolate and allow it to steep for 1 minute. Whisk the mixture together. Whisk in the sour cream and vanilla. Set aside.
3. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, then whisk the mixture by hand to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed.
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and both sugars together on medium-high speed until light, about 3 minutes. As you make the batter, stop the mixer frequently and scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. On low speed, drizzle the oil into the mixture until blended. Turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat until the batter is fluffy, about 3 more minutes. Blend in the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, adding the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared into the batter. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the chocolate mixture in two parts, beginning and ending with the flour. After each addition, mix until just barely blended and stop and scrape the bowl. Stop the mixer before the last of the flour has been incorporated and complete the blending by hand with a rubber spatula to ensure you do not overbeat the batter.
5. Divide the thick batter equally among the prepared pans (there will be approximately 1 pound 2 ounces per pan). Smooth the tops and tap the pans on the counter to settle the batter and eliminate any large air bubbles. Bake in the middle of the oven until the centers spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Flip the cakes out of the pans, leaving on the parchment paper until you assemble the cake. Let them continue to cool on the rack, top sides up, until they reach room temperature.
6. To assemble the cake, lay one of the cakes top side up on a cake plate. Using a metal spatula, frost the top with 3/4 cup of buttercream, spreading it out to the edge of the cake (the filling will be about 1/4 inch thick). Stack the second cake top side up on top of the frosted cake and spread another 3/4 cup of buttercream on top of it. Stack the last layer of cake top side up on top. Look for any frosting that may have oozed out between the layers and spread it along the sides of the cake. Apply a thin layer of frosting all over the cake to create a ""crumb coat."" Place the cake in the refrigerator until the frosting is firm, about 10 minutes. Take it out and frost the cake with the remaining buttercream, using your spatula to make decorative swirls.
7. Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

"When mixing the batter for **The Pink Cake**, alternating the flour mixture and the chocolate mixture serves to evenly incorporate the ingredients without overmixing. This method ensures that the dry and wet ingredients are blended in such a way that the cake achieves a fluffy texture while preventing gluten from developing too much, which can lead to a tough cake.

Here are the ingredients and instructions for making **The Pink Cake**:

### Ingredients
- Three 8 by 2-inch round cake pans, greased and bottoms lined with greased parchment paper circles
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 1/4 cup (1 ounce) lightly packed premium unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- 3/4 cup (6 3/4 ounces) full-fat sour cream
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup (7 1/2 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar
- 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 3 egg yolks, at room temperature
- 3 eggs, at room temperature
- Raspberry Buttercream

### Instructions
1. Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Put the unsweetened chocolate and cocoa into a small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the chocolate and allow it to steep for 1 minute. Whisk the mixture together and whisk in the sour cream and vanilla. Set aside.
3. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, then whisk the mixture by hand to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed.
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and both sugars together on medium-high speed until light, about 3 minutes. As you make the batter, stop the mixer frequently and scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. On low speed, drizzle the oil into the mixture until blended. Turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat until the batter is fluffy for about 3 more minutes. Blend in the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, adding the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared into the batter. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the chocolate mixture in two parts, beginning and ending with the flour. After each addition, mix until just barely blended and stop to scrape the bowl. Stop the mixer before the last of the flour has been incorporated and complete blending by hand with a rubber spatula to ensure you do not overbeat the batter.
5. Divide the thick batter equally among the prepared pans (there will be approximately 1 pound 2 ounces per pan). Smooth the tops and tap the pans on the counter to settle the batter and eliminate any large air bubbles. Bake in the middle of the oven until the centers spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Flip the cakes out of the pans, leaving on the parchment paper until you assemble the cake. Let them continue to cool on the rack, top sides up, until they reach room temperature.
6. To assemble the cake, lay one of the cakes top side up on a cake plate. Using a metal spatula, frost the top with 3/4 cup of buttercream, spreading it out to the edge of the cake (the filling will be about 1/4 inch thick). Stack the second cake top side up on top of the frosted cake and spread another 3/4 cup of buttercream on top of it. Stack the last layer of cake top side up on top. Look for any frosting that may have oozed out between the layers and spread it along the sides of the cake. Apply a thin layer of frosting all over the cake to create a ""crumb coat."" Place the cake in the refrigerator until the frosting is firm, about 10 minutes. Take it out and frost the cake with the remaining buttercream, using your spatula to make decorative swirls.
7. Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

"In the **Chicken-Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy** recipe, whipping the egg whites until very foamy but not quite holding peaks is essential for creating a light and crispy coating on the steaks. The airy texture of the whipped egg whites helps the panko breadcrumbs adhere better and provides a delicious texture when the steaks are baked, making them golden brown and crispy.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup whole-wheat flour
- 2 cups whole-wheat panko breadcrumbs, such as lans All-Natural
- 3 large egg whites
- Four 3-ounce portions lean filet mignon, pounded about 1/3 inch thick
- Nonstick cooking spray
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

3. Place the steaks on the wire rack and spray them with cooking spray. Season the steaks with salt and pepper to taste, and roast until they are golden brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick saute pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the sausage and stir it to break it up. Cook the sausage until it is just done about 4 minutes.
5. While the sausage is cooking, whisk the chicken broth into the cornstarch in a small bowl.
6. Add the cornstarch mixture to the sausage and bring it to a simmer. When the gravy has thickened slightly (after about 2 minutes), remove the pan from the heat.

"For this recipe, you should use **skirt steak**. 

Here are the details for the Grilled Beef Skirt Steak With Onion Marinade:

### Ingredients
- 1/2 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped
- 1 small garlic clove, peeled
- 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon water
- 2 pounds skirt steak, silver skin trimmed away
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- Smoked sea salt, for finishing
- Ox’s Chimichurri, for serving (optional)

### Instructions
1. Combine the onion, garlic, 1/4 cup of the oil, and water in a blender; blend until smooth. Put the skirt steak in a large resealable plastic bag or baking dish and pour in the onion mixture, coating both sides. Cover or wrap the meat well so the onion scent does not permeate your refrigerator; chill for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
2. Prepare a grill to medium-high heat.
3. Remove the steak from the marinade and season both sides with the kosher salt and pepper. Transfer the meat to the grill and let cook until one side is well seared, 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more, for rare to medium-rare. At this point, remove the steak from the grill and let rest for 2 minutes to allow the carryover heat to give it a more even doneness. Finally, return the steak to the grill and cook for 1 minute more per side (this guarantees this thin cut of steak will be served hot). (Add another minute of cooking on the second side for medium doneness.) Remove the skirt steak from the grill and let rest 1 to 2 minutes before slicing and serving.

"If your sauce isn't thickening as expected, you may want to use the techniques from the **Mac Sauce (Béchamel 101)**. Here’s a detailed approach based on its instructions:

### Ingredients
- * 3 cups whole milk
- * 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- * 2 teaspoons kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt

### Instructions
1. Heat the milk in a pot over medium heat until it just starts to bubble, but is not boiling, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
2. In a separate, heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and whisk constantly until the mixture turns light brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Slowly pour the warm milk into the butter-flour mixture, about 1 cup at a time, whisking constantly. It may get very thick initially, but it will eventually thin out as you add all 3 cups.
4. After adding all the milk, return the pot to medium-high heat and whisk constantly for the next 2 to 3 minutes until the sauce becomes silky and thick. Use the spoon test to check thickness: the sauce should coat the spoon and not slide off easily.
5. Season with salt, and remember that if the sauce is too thick when you want to serve, add a little milk to reach the desired consistency.

Using these steps, you should be able to achieve the right thickness for your sauce!

"The purpose of the egg glaze in the preparation of turnovers is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, egg washes are generally used to create a shiny, golden brown finish on baked goods and to help pastries adhere together.

Here's an example of a dish that involves eggs:

### Egg in the Middle

**Ingredients:**
- 2 slices bread, preferably whole wheat
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 eggs

**Instructions:**
1. First stamp a circle from the center of each slice of bread with a 2-inch cookie cutter and reserve.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan or skillet over medium heat, add the bread and reserved rounds ('hats') and fry until the undersides are lightly golden.
3. Turn the bread over, adding more oil if necessary.
4. Carefully break the eggs and ease them into the holes. (Sometimes I drain off a little of the white, but this is not a rule.)
5. Reduce the heat and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are beginning to set, but are still soft.
6. Using a spatula, transfer the slices of bread and eggs to a plate, with their hats over the yolks, and serve.

"To make the **Spiced Praline Meringues**, you should preheat the oven to **375°F / 190°C**.

### Ingredients
* 1/3 cup (50 g) blanched slivered almonds
* 1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp water
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp ground cloves
* Finely grated zest of 1 large orange (1 tbsp)
* 1/4 tsp flaky sea salt
* 5 1/4 oz (150 g) egg whites (from 4 large eggs)

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C.
2. Spread the almonds out on a small rimmed baking sheet and roast in the oven for 5–7 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
3. Place 1/4 cup/50 g of the sugar in a small saucepan with the water and stir to combine. Cook over high heat for about 4 minutes, until it has turned a light golden brown; do not stir, just gently shake the pan to help the sugar dissolve. Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute, so the nuts are coated and the caramel turns dark, without burning. Pour the mixture onto one of the lined baking sheets and set aside until cool.
4. Once cool, break the praline into smaller pieces, place in a food processor and process to form a rough powder. Remove from the machine, place in a shallow bowl and combine with the spices, orange zest and salt. Set aside.
5. Spread the remaining sugar out on the second lined baking sheet and place in the oven for 7 minutes, until the sugar is hot. Remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 275°F/130°C. As soon as the sugar is out of the oven, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on high speed until they begin to froth up. Carefully add the hot sugar to the egg whites, 1 tbsp at a time, and continue beating for 7–8 minutes until the mixture is completely cold. At this point it should be silky and thick and keep its shape when you lift a little bit from the bowl.
6. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Use an extra-large serving spoon to scoop up some meringue, and use another large spoon to help shape it into a rough ball the size of a large apple. Sprinkle some praline over half the meringue ball, then place on the baking sheet, repeat with the rest of the mixture, spacing the balls as far apart as possible, as they will increase in size.
7. Place the meringues in the oven for 2–2 1/2 hours. Check that they are done by lifting them from the baking sheet and gently tapping to make sure the outside is completely firm and the center is only a little soft. Remove from the oven and leave on the baking sheet to cool.
8. These will keep for up to 10 days. If you are not hanging them on the tree, wrap them loosely in aluminum foil and keep at room temperature.

- 1 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
- 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds
- 4 (4–6-oz.) skin-on salmon fillets
- Kosher salt
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced
- Cooked rice for serving

### Instructions
1. Whisk ginger, miso, honey, vinegar, oil, and 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to combine; set sauce aside.

"The purpose of nutmeg in the **Apple-Walnut Upside-Down Cake** recipe is to enhance the flavor profile of the cake, adding warmth and a hint of spiciness that complements the sweetness of the apples and the richness of the walnuts.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup raw walnuts or pecans
- 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, divided
- 4 small or 3 large baking apples (such as Pink Lady), peeled, halved, cored
- ½ cup (packed) light brown sugar, divided
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- ½ tsp. baking powder
- ¼ tsp. freshly grated nutmeg
- 1½ tsp. ground cinnamon, plus more for serving
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- ½ cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt, room temperature
- Lightly sweetened softly whipped cream (for serving)

### Instructions:
1. Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°F. Spread out walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Let cool.
2. Meanwhile, heat a 10"" ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Add 2 Tbsp. butter and swirl to coat; arrange apple halves cut sides down in a single layer in skillet. Cook apples, undisturbed, rotating skillet on burner as needed for even browning, until cut sides are golden brown, 5–10 minutes (the timing depends on the juiciness of the apples; juicier apples will take longer). Turn apples over and cook on rounded sides just until they start to release their juices and the tip of a knife slides through with slight resistance, about 5 minutes. Transfer apples to a plate, arrange cut sides up, and let cool.
3. Add ¼ cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp. water to skillet and set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden spoon or heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved, then cook, swirling skillet occasionally (do not stir at this point), until thick and bubbling in a thin layer, about 1 minute. Let caramel cool in skillet.
4. Meanwhile, pulse toasted walnuts, flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and 1½ tsp. cinnamon in a food processor until combined and nuts are finely ground. Transfer walnut mixture to a medium bowl.
5. Combine granulated sugar, remaining ¼ cup brown sugar, and remaining 8 Tbsp. butter in food processor (no need to wash it) and process in long pulses until mixture is light and smooth. Add eggs and vanilla and process in long pulses, scraping down sides of processor once, until mixture is smooth. Add half of walnut mixture and pulse to combine, then add yogurt and pulse just until incorporated. Add remaining walnut mixture and pulse just to combine.
6. Arrange apple halves cut sides down over cooled caramel in skillet, spacing evenly. Fold batter a few times with spatula, scraping sides to make sure everything is well mixed. Scrape batter over apples and work into spaces around apples. Smooth surface (it’s okay if there’s only a thin layer of batter in places; it will rise in the oven).
7. Bake cake until it is browned across the entire surface and the center springs back when gently pressed, 30–40 minutes. Let cake cool in skillet 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula or a small knife around the sides of the pan to loosen. Set a wire rack upside down on skillet and flip over to release cake; carefully remove skillet. If any apples or cake stick to skillet, scrape them off and press back onto the top of the cake.
8. Serve cake warm or room temperature. Slice into wedges and top with dollops of whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon.
9. Do Ahead: Cake can be baked 2 days ahead. Let cool completely. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

"When cooking fish skin side down, you should let it cook gradually until the skin is super-crisp and the flesh is mostly opaque. This typically takes about **8–12 minutes longer** after initially laying the fish in the cold skillet and letting it heat up, depending on the thickness of the fish. 

Here's the recipe for reference:

### Crispy-Skinned Fish with Herb Sauce

**Ingredients:**
- 2 oil-packed anchovy fillets (optional)
- 1 small garlic clove, thinly sliced
- 1 cup chopped tender herbs (such as parsley, dill, and/or basil)
- 1 Tbsp. chopped pickles (capers, cornichons, or chile)
- 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon or lime juice or white wine vinegar
- 6 Tbsp. (or more) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 4 (5–6-oz.) skin-on black bass, striped bass, snapper, or salmon fillets
- Flaky sea salt

**Instructions:**
1. Using the side of a chef’s knife, mash anchovies (if using) and garlic on a cutting board until a coarse paste forms. Mix in a medium bowl with herbs, pickles, lemon juice, and 5 Tbsp. oil. Season green sauce with kosher salt and pepper.

2. Swirl remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet to coat. Season fish generously on both sides with salt and lay, skin side down, in cold skillet. Place skillet over medium heat and let it gradually heat up until fat starts to cook out of fish, about 4 minutes. At this point you may press gently on fish so that the skin is flat against the pan. Continue to cook until skin is super-crisp and flesh is mostly opaque (you can increase or decrease heat slightly if needed, but don’t try to rush it), 8–12 minutes longer, depending on the thickness of the fish. Less fatty fish won’t release as much fat on their own, so you may need to add a splash more oil to the skillet if the skin isn’t getting crisp enough. Turn fish and cook just until opaque all the way through, about 1 minute.

3. Spoon green sauce onto a platter and carefully set fish, skin side up, on top. Sprinkle with sea salt.

"To know when the mixture for the Shimbra Wat is done cooking and ready to serve, observe the following:

The mixture should be covered and cooked over the lowest possible heat for about 20 minutes while stirring frequently. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture is still a bit runny and has not dried out—if needed, you can add a little more water to maintain that consistency.

### Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons brown or golden flaxseed
- 3 tablespoons awaze dipping sauce
- 14 oz (400 g) cooked or canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- Salt

### Instructions:
1. Heat a small dry frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the flaxseed and lightly dry-toast for about 2 minutes, stirring and shaking the pan, until aromatic. Transfer to a dish and leave to cool. Once cool, grind using an electric spice or coffee grinder.
2. In a Dutch oven or sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of water over low heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of the awaze. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously, then gradually work in the remaining 2 tablespoons of awaze, along with the ground flaxseed and 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Reduce the heat to its lowest possible level, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes. Add a touch more water if it looks like the mixture is drying out—it should still be a bit runny at the end.
3. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas in a saucepan and cover with 2 cups (500 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and soak in the liquid until ready to use. Drain the chickpeas, reserving about 1 cup (240 ml) of the liquid. Add the chickpeas to the awaze-flaxseed mixture, generously season with salt, and mix well.

"To properly prepare the brisket for Bún Bò Hue, you'll want to follow these detailed steps:

### Ingredients
- 2 pounds oxtail, cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces (ask your butcher to do this)
- 2 pounds beef shank bones, cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces (ask your butcher to do this)
- 2 pounds pork neck bones
- 2 pounds beef marrowbones, cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces (ask your butcher to do this)
- **1 pound beef brisket**
- 8 lemongrass stalks
- 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon annatto seeds, ground
- 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 cup sliced shallots (2 extra-large shallots)
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1/4 cup finely chopped lemongrass
- 2 teaspoons shrimp paste
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 (14-ounce) package dried round rice noodles, cooked according to package directions, or 3 pounds fresh rice noodles
- Thai basil sprigs
- Perilla leaves
- Thinly sliced green or red cabbage
- Lemon wedges
- Lime wedges
- Thinly sliced yellow onion

### Instructions
1. Make the stock: To ensure the pot is large enough to blanch the bones without boiling over, put the bones in the pot and add water to cover by 1 inch. Then remove the bones and set aside.
2. Bring the water to a boil. When at a rolling boil, add the oxtails, beef shank, and pork bones. Boil for 3 minutes, then drain the bones into a colander and rinse under cold running water. Rinse the pot and return the rinsed oxtails, neck bones, and shanks to the pot. Add the marrowbones and brisket.
3. Cut off the pale, fleshy part (the bottom 4 inches) of each lemongrass stalk and discard the leafy tops. Crush the lemongrass with the side of a cleaver or the bottom of a heavy pan and add it to the pot. Add 8 quarts of fresh water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat so the liquid is at a simmer and skim off any scum that rises to the surface.
4. After 45 minutes, ready an ice-water bath, then check the brisket for doneness using the chopstick test: transfer the brisket to a plate and poke it with a chopstick; the juices should run clear. If not, return it to the pot and continue cooking, checking again in 10 minutes. When done, remove from the pot (reserve the cooking liquid) and immediately submerge in the ice-water bath, which will stop the cooking and give the meat a firmer texture. Once completely cool, pat dry and refrigerate.
5. Continue to simmer the stock for another 2 hours, skimming as needed. Remove and discard the large solids, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan. Skim most of the fat from the surface of the stock (leave some for flavor) and return the stock to simmer over medium heat.
6. In a spice grinder or mortar, grind the red pepper flakes and annatto seeds into a coarse powder. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat, add the ground spices, and cook, stirring, for 10 seconds. Add the shallots, garlic, lemongrass, and shrimp paste; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more until aromatic.
7. Add the frying pan contents to the simmering stock along with salt and sugar, and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.
8. To serve, prepare garnishes (basil, perilla, cabbage, lemon and lime wedges, onion slices). Thinly slice brisket against the grain, divide cooked noodles into bowls, place brisket slices on noodles, ladle hot stock over, and serve immediately with garnishes.

"It's important to reserve some of the chicken broth after cooking the chicken because it enhances the flavor and moisture of dishes, especially when serving with ingredients like turnips or for sauces. The reserved broth can be used to keep dishes from drying out and to add richness to recipes.

### Ingredients
* 12 cups water
* 8 garlic cloves
* 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced
* 4 whole star anise
* 4 bay leaves
* 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
* 1 (4-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces
* 4 carrots
* 4 celery stalks
* 2 unpeeled white or red onions, halved
* Salt, for seasoning
* Chopped parsley leaves and lemon wedges for serving

### Instructions
1. Wipe the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking. Build a two-zone fire. Your high-heat zone should have embers 1 to 2 inches from the cooking surface, with occasional flames licking it. To create your medium-heat zone, nudge the embers 2 to 3 inches lower than that.
2. Fill a stockpot with the water, garlic, ginger, star anise, bay leaves, and peppercorns and place over medium heat. Place the chicken, carrots, celery, and onions over high heat and cook, turning occasionally, until well charred all over, about 15 minutes total. When each ingredient is done, add it to the pot (it’s important that each ingredient be very well browned—almost burnt—before adding to the pot). Cook the stock for at least 3 hours, adding additional water if necessary to keep the meat and vegetables covered. Season with salt at the end.
3. Remove the pot from heat. Remove the chicken pieces and shred the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Strain the stock, discarding solids.
4. To serve, place a pile of shredded chicken into each bowl and cover with hot stock. Pass the parsley and lemon wedges separately. The stock can be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.

"In the **Sweet Rice-Flour and Coconut Cake** recipe, you cannot substitute coconut flour directly, since the recipe specifically calls for **mochiko** (sweet rice flour) and incorporates coconut milk. These ingredients work together to create the unique texture of the cake. However, if you're looking for alternatives, you could consider using a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend, but the flavor and texture will differ.

### Ingredients
- 3 cups mochiko (sweet rice flour; 1 lb)
- 2 1/2 cups sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 (14-oz) cans unsweetened coconut milk (not low-fat)

"To arrange the trout on the baking sheet before roasting, follow these steps:

1. Lay the butterflied trout open like a book, skin side down.
2. Alternate the trout head-to-tail next to each other on one half of a lined baking sheet.

### Ingredients
- 2 whole butterflied trout (about 12 oz. each), heads removed
- 2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning
- 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, divided
- 1 lemon, thinly sliced
- 3 medium ears of corn, kernels cut from cobs (about 3 cups)
- 6 oz. green beans, cut into 1"" pieces
- 1 large tomato, cut into 1"" pieces
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- 3/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions
1. Arrange a rack in the top third of the oven; preheat to 450°F. Line an 18x13"" rimmed baking sheet with foil.

"The purpose of blanching tomatoes before marinating them is typically to enhance their flavor and texture. Blanching helps to loosen the skin, making it easier to remove, and also brightens the color of the tomatoes while softening them slightly, which can improve the overall marinating process and the absorption of seasonings.

Here's a delicious recipe for **Baked Tomatoes**, which involves prepping the tomatoes nicely before baking:

### Ingredients
- 1/2 loaf Italian bread (about 8 ounces)
- 5 to 6 sprigs flat-leaf Italian parsley
- 1 medium clove garlic
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
- 2 large tomatoes or 4 small ones

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 250°F. Cut away and discard the crust from the loaf of bread and cut the loaf in half lengthwise. Bake for 5 minutes on each side. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Raise the oven temperature to 350°F on convection heat or to 375°F in an oven without convection heat.
3. Cut the bread into chunks small enough to fit easily in a food processor. Place them in the food processor and pulse until you have fairly even crumbs that are not too fine. Set aside 1 cup of crumbs and reserve any extra for another use.
4. Finely chop enough parsley leaves to measure about 2 tablespoons. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Put the parsley, garlic, bread crumbs, capers, salt, and olive oil in a mixing bowl. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly distributed and the bread crumbs are well coated with the olive oil. If there doesn't seem to be enough olive oil to coat them all, add a little more.
5. Cut the tomatoes in half crosswise and scoop out all the seeds. Place the tomatoes, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Fill the cavities with a generous amount of the bread-crumb mixture, heaping it on top of each tomato half.
6. Bake until a brown crust forms, about 20 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.

- 4 garlic cloves, crushed with the flat blade of a knife
- 1 teaspoon sea salt

"After straining the liquid from the pot in the recipe for **The Minimalist's Corn Chowder**, you should strip the kernels from the corn cobs using a sharp knife. Make sure to catch any liquid that seeps out during the process. This step is essential before incorporating the corn kernels into your chowder.

"Yes, you can substitute the almonds in the Skordalia recipe with another nut or ingredient. Just like walnuts are used in the Mashed Potato Skordalia, you can opt for different nuts such as walnuts, pecans, or even sunflower seeds for a nut-free option. The key is to ensure that the flavor complements the garlic and lemon in the dip.

### Ingredients
* 1/2 small potato, peeled
* Salt and pepper
* 2 cloves garlic, or to taste
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 2 slices bread, crusts removed and slices soaked in water
* 1/2 cup (60 grams) almonds, toasted
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1 cup (250 milliliters) extra-virgin olive oil

### Instructions
1. Boil the potato in a small pot of salted water.
2. Add the 2 cloves of garlic and sea salt to a blender or food processor, and pulse until it becomes a thick paste. Add more garlic if desired. Squeeze the water from the bread, and drain the potato, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the bread and potato to the garlic paste along with the almonds and half the lemon juice. Process until the mixture is well combined, but still slightly coarse in texture.
3. While the processor is running, start to slowly pour the olive oil into the mixture. If it is too thick, add a spoonful of the reserved potato water and continue to add the oil. Once the mixture becomes lighter in color and thinner in texture, stop and taste your creation. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add a little of the remaining lemon juice.

"To know when the duck breasts are cooked to medium-rare in the **Duck Breast with Roasted Peaches and Walnut-Parsley Fried Rice** recipe, you can use an instant-read thermometer. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the duck breast; when it reads **135°F**, the duck is medium-rare.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups jasmine rice
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 medium limes)
- 3 tablespoons fresh ginger, finely chopped (from 2-inch-long knob)
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil, plus more if needed to add to duck fat
- 3 medium peaches, unpeeled, halved vertically and pitted
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 6 (8-ounce) boneless duck breasts with skin
- 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt or other coarse salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, preferably white
- 3/4 cup veal or duck demi-glace
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1/2 medium shallot, finely chopped
- 1 cup walnut pieces, toasted and chopped
- 1 cup fresh parsley leaves, coarsely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth
- 3/4 cups mixed micro greens
- 2 tablespoons fresh chives, finely chopped

### Instructions
1. In a large, heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, combine rice and 4 1/2 cups water and bring to gentle boil. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 20 minutes. Spread on a large rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, until cool and dry, at least 2 hours or overnight.
2. In a small saucepan over moderately high heat, stir together 1 cup water, soy sauce, lime juice, ginger, garlic, and sesame oil. Simmer, uncovered, until reduced by 15 percent, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove soy-lime emulsion from heat and set aside to cool.
3. Preheat oven to 375°F. In an 8-inch cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat, heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil until hot but not smoking. Coat the cut sides of peaches with sugar, transfer peaches, cut side down, to the skillet, and cook until sugar just begins to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and roast peaches until the edge of the skin is easy to lift away from the flesh (leave skin on), about 6 to 7 minutes. Keep peaches warm and leave oven on.
4. Pat duck breasts dry. Using a sharp knife, score skin in a 1-inch crosshatch pattern, taking care not to cut through fat into meat below. Sprinkle breasts with salt and pepper.
5. In a large, ovenproof skillet over moderately low heat, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, sear duck breasts skin side down until the skin is golden brown and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. As fat is rendered, periodically drain off and reserve. Return all 6 breasts to skillet, skin side up. Transfer skillet to oven and roast breasts to desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes for medium-rare (instant-read thermometer inserted into breasts will read 135°F). Keep warm.
6. In a small, heavy saucepan over high heat, simmer demi-glace until reduced by 25 percent, about 5 minutes. Stir in butter and keep warm.
7. While demi-glace is reducing, prepare the fried rice: Measure reserved duck fat and add vegetable oil if necessary to make 3 tablespoons. In a large, well-seasoned wok or large, deep, heavy skillet over high heat, heat fat until just smoking. Add shallots and stir-fry until translucent, about 1 minute. Add walnuts, rice, parsley, chicken stock, and 1 cup soy-lime emulsion and stir-fry until the rice is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm.
8. Holding a sharp knife at a 45-degree angle, cut each duck breast into thin slices. Divide rice among 6 large plates and lay duck slices over each mound. Drizzle each with demi-glace and mound microgreens on top. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately.

"If your yeast doesn't foam after mixing it with warm water for the Coffee-Glazed Doughnuts, you should discard the mixture and start over with new yeast. Yeast that doesn't foam is likely inactive, which means your dough will not rise properly.

Here are the ingredients you will need for the Coffee-Glazed Doughnuts:

### Ingredients
- 1 (1/4-oz) package active dry yeast (2 1/2 teaspoons)
- 2 tablespoons warm water (105–115°F)
- 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour plus additional for sprinkling and rolling out dough
- 1 cup whole milk at room temperature
- 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened
- 3 large egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- About 10 cups vegetable oil for deep frying
- 1/4 cup boiling-hot water
- 5 teaspoons instant-espresso powder or instant-coffee granules
- 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar
- 1 tablespoon light corn syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- About 1/4 cup sanding sugar (optional)

### Instructions
1. Stir together yeast and warm water in a small bowl until yeast is dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If yeast doesn't foam, discard and start over with new yeast.)
2. Mix together flour, milk, butter, yolks, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and yeast mixture in mixer at low speed until a soft dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat 3 minutes more.
3. Scrape dough down side of bowl (all around) into center, then sprinkle lightly with flour (to keep a crust from forming). Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Alternatively, let dough rise in bowl in refrigerator 8 to 12 hours.)
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round (1/2 inch thick). Cut out as many rounds as possible with 3-inch cutter, then cut a hole in center of each round with 1-inch cutter and transfer doughnuts to a lightly floured large baking sheet. Cover doughnuts with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until slightly puffed, about 30 minutes (45 minutes if dough was cold when cutting out doughnuts). Do not reroll scraps.
5. Heat 2 1/2 inches oil in a deep 4-quart heavy pot until it registers 350°F on thermometer. Fry doughnuts, 2 at a time, turning occasionally with a wire or mesh skimmer or a slotted spoon, until puffed and golden brown, about 2 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain. (Return oil to 350°F between batches.)
6. Stir together boiling-hot water and espresso powder in a medium bowl until powder is dissolved, then stir in confectioners sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and salt until smooth.
7. Dip doughnuts into glaze, turning to coat well, then put on a rack set in a shallow baking pan (to catch any drips). While glaze is wet, sprinkle doughnuts with sanding sugar (if using). Let stand until glaze is set, about 20 minutes.

"The purpose of using a candy thermometer in the Cherry-Pistachio Nougat preparation is to accurately measure the temperature of the sugar syrup while it is boiling. This ensures that the syrup reaches the precise temperature of 252°F, which is crucial for the correct consistency and texture of the nougat. 

### Ingredients:
- Nonstick vegetable oil spray
- 1 cup natural unsalted pistachios
- 1 1/3 cups sugar
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1 large egg white, room temperature

- 3/4 cup dried cherries
- 2 8x11"" sheets of edible rice paper, trimmed to 8x8"" (wafer paper)
- Ingredient info: Edible rice paper, a.k.a. wafer paper, can be found at baking supply stores and beryls.com.
- An 8x8"" baking pan; a candy thermometer

### Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Lightly coat baking pan with nonstick spray. Line with plastic wrap, leaving a 1"" overhang on all sides. Set aside.
2. Spread out pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring once, until just beginning to turn light golden brown in spots, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Coarsely chop and set aside.
3. Combine sugar, honey, and 2 tablespoons water in a small deep heavy saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of pan. Increase heat and boil until thermometer registers 252°F, about 3 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, beat egg white and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until soft peaks form.
5. With mixer running, gradually stream hot syrup into egg whites. Beat until meringue is thick, has tripled in volume, and has cooled slightly, 10-12 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer and add cherries and pistachios to meringue; mix nougat with a rubber spatula to distribute evenly.
6. Place one 8x8"" sheet of rice paper (or 8x8"" sheet of parchment paper sprayed with nonstick spray) in the prepared pan. Transfer nougat to pan, spreading in an even layer. Top with second sheet of rice paper (or 8x8"" sheet of parchment paper sprayed with nonstick spray). Using an offset spatula, press the nougat into an even layer. Let stand at room temperature until set, about 2 hours.

"The purpose of weighting the cabbage with a plate and a can is to ensure that the cabbage stays upright while it cooks on the grill. This method helps the cabbage cook evenly and allows the beer can to create a steaming effect, which enhances the flavor and texture of the cabbage as it absorbs the moisture and flavors from the beer.

Here's a recipe where this technique is used:

### Beer-Can Cabbage Sandwiches

#### Ingredients
* 1 large purple cabbage (about 3 1/2 pounds)
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more
* 1 (12-ounce) can pale lager
* 2 cups homemade or store-bought barbecue sauce (preferably Kraft Original Barbecue Sauce), divided
* 1/2 large white onion, cut into 1/2"" rings
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 1/4 teaspoon honey
* 1 medium carrot (about 6 ounces), coarsely grated using the grater disk on a food processor or the largest holes on a box grater
* 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
* 6 seeded Kaiser rolls or sturdy hamburger buns
* 12 slices cheddar cheese
* Sliced pickled jalapeños (for serving)

#### Instructions
1. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Cut a 3x3"" square around the core of the cabbage at the base. Carefully remove the core with a knife. Create a 3""–deep cavity in the cabbage, big enough to hold a beer can. Discard the core but reserve leftover cabbage. Coat the cabbage with oil and season generously with salt and pepper.
2. Pour out (or drink) half of the beer. Place the beer can in the cavity of the cabbage so it sits upright. Transfer to the grill and coat the cabbage with 3 Tbsp. barbecue sauce. Cover and cook, brushing with sauce every 15 minutes, until the leaves are crispy and dark brown, about 45–50 minutes. Grill white onion rings during the last 5 minutes until charred.
3. Meanwhile, whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, honey, and remaining salt and pepper in a bowl. Slice reserved cabbage and add to the dressing along with carrot and red onion; toss.
4. Remove cabbage from the grill, discard the can, and let cool slightly. Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise and slice into strips. Toss with the remaining barbecue sauce in a bowl.
5. Grill halved rolls until toasted, about 30 seconds. Arrange barbecued cabbage on each bottom bun, topping with cheese, cabbage slaw, and jalapeños if desired. Top with the bun.
6. Barbecued cabbage and coleslaw can be made up to 3 days in advance; chill and reheat as needed.

"According to the recipe for **No-Knead Bread**, it is essential not to add more flour during the kneading process. Although the dough may be quite loose and sticky, the developed gluten in the dough should cling in long, thin strands. If you add more flour, it can affect the texture and structure of the bread.

### Ingredients:
- 3 cups (400 grams) bread flour
- 1 1/4 teaspoons (8 grams) table salt
- 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) instant or other active dry yeast
- 1 1/3 cups (300 grams) cool water (55 to 65 degrees F)
- Wheat bran, cornmeal, or additional flour, for dusting
- A 4 1/2- to 5 1/2-quart heavy pot

### Instructions:
1. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and mix until you have a wet, sticky dough, about 30 seconds. 
2. When the first fermentation is complete, generously dust a work surface with flour. Scrape the dough onto the board; it will be loose and sticky—do not add more flour.
3. Place a tea towel on your work surface and dust it with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour. Lift the dough onto the towel, seam side down, and let it rise.
4. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F, with a rack in the lower third position, and place a heavy pot in the center of the rack.
5. Carefully remove the hot pot from the oven and invert the dough into it, seam side up, then cover and bake.
6. Remove the lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep chestnut color.

"It looks like there are no specific instructions provided for the dough rising time for cakes in the recipes available. However, typically for cake recipes, there is no dough rising time like there is for yeast breads. Instead, cake batter is usually baked immediately after mixing.

Here’s a summary of the ingredients and instructions related to one of the cakes, **The Pink Cake**:

### Ingredients:
- 3 (8 by 2-inch) round cake pans, greased and bottoms lined with greased parchment paper circles
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 1/4 cup (1 ounce) lightly packed premium unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- 3/4 cup (6 3/4 ounces) full-fat sour cream
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup (7 1/2 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar
- 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 3 egg yolks, at room temperature
- 3 eggs, at room temperature
- Raspberry Buttercream

### Instructions:
1. Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Put the unsweetened chocolate and cocoa into a small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the chocolate and allow it to steep for 1 minute. Whisk the mixture together. Whisk in the sour cream and vanilla. Set aside.
3. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, then whisk the mixture by hand to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed.
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and both sugars together on medium-high speed until light, about 3 minutes. As you make the batter, stop the mixer frequently and scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. On low speed, drizzle the oil into the mixture until blended. Turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat until the batter is fluffy, about 3 more minutes. Blend in the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, adding the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared into the batter. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the chocolate mixture in two parts, beginning and ending with the flour. After each addition, mix until just barely blended and stop and scrape the bowl. Stop the mixer before the last of the flour has been incorporated and complete the blending by hand with a rubber spatula to ensure you do not overbeat the batter.
5. Divide the thick batter equally among the prepared pans (there will be approximately 1 pound 2 ounces per pan). Smooth the tops and tap the pans on the counter to settle the batter and eliminate any large air bubbles. Bake in the middle of the oven until the centers spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Flip the cakes out of the pans, leaving on the parchment paper until you assemble the cake. Let them continue to cool on the rack, top sides up, until they reach room temperature.
6. To assemble the cake, lay one of the cakes top side up on a cake plate. Using a metal spatula, frost the top with 3/4 cup of buttercream, spreading it out to the edge of the cake (the filling will be about 1/4 inch thick). Stack the second cake top side up on top of the frosted cake and spread another 3/4 cup of buttercream on top of it. Stack the last layer of cake top side up on top. Look for any frosting that may have oozed out between the layers and spread it along the sides of the cake. Apply a thin layer of frosting all over the cake to create a ""crumb coat."" Place the cake in the refrigerator until the frosting is firm, about 10 minutes. Take it out and frost the cake with the remaining buttercream, using your spatula to make decorative swirls.
7. Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

"Wringing out the potato-onion mixture in a dishtowel serves the purpose of removing excess liquid. This step is crucial because it helps ensure that the latkes or potato pancakes have a crispier texture when fried. If the mixture retains too much moisture, the pancakes may become soggy instead of achieving that desirable crispy exterior.

### Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 pounds Idaho russet potatoes
- 1 medium onion
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1/2 cup finely chopped scallions (white and green parts)
- 1/4 cup potato flour or matzo meal
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- Canola or vegetable oil, for frying
- Sour cream, for serving
- Applesauce, for serving

### Instructions:
1. Place a large strainer over a large bowl. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate some of the potatoes, followed by some of the onion, into the strainer. Repeat until all of the potatoes and onion are used up. (Alternating the potatoes and onion prevents the potatoes from discoloring.) Squeeze or press out as much of the liquid as possible. Allow the accumulated liquid to stand in another bowl for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour off the watery part but reserve the thick, starchy paste at the bottom.
2. Transfer the potato-onion mixture to a clean large bowl. Add the starchy paste, egg yolks, scallions, potato flour or matzo meal, butter, salt, pepper, and baking powder and mix well. In a separate medium bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until they hold stiff, shiny peaks. Fold the egg whites into the potato mixture.
3. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into the pan for each pancake. Flatten gently with a spatula. Fry until the pancakes are crisp and golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
4. Serve immediately or reheat in a 350°F oven for about 6 minutes. Serve with sour cream and applesauce.

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups cake flour
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (can be a substitute for cake flour)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 1/4 cups sugar
- 8 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup grated lemon zest (from about 4 lemons)
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted or more if needed
- 4 to 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the sides and bottom of two 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray. Line the bottom with parchment paper and spray the paper.
2. Sift both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.
3. Put the sugar, eggs, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a food processor and pulse until combined. With the motor running, drizzle the butter in through the feed tube. Add the sour cream and vanilla and pulse until combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.
4. Sprinkle the flour mixture, one third at a time, folding gently after each addition until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes, rotate the pans, reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F., and bake for another 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean.
6. Let cool in the pans for 15 minutes.

10. (The soaked but unglazed loaves will keep, wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap and frozen, for up to 6 weeks.)
11. In a small bowl, whisk together the confectioners' sugar and 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice. The mixture should be thick but pourable. If the mixture is too stiff, add up to another 2 tablespoons lemon juice and whisk again, adding small amounts of lemon juice and/or confectioners' sugar until you get the right consistency. Pour the lemon glaze over the top of each loaf and let it drip down the sides. Let the lemon glaze harden, about 15 minutes, before serving.
12. The glazed loaves will keep for up to 3 days, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, at room temperature.

"Yes, it is necessary to have the fish cleaned with head and tail intact for the recipe ""Whole Grilled Fish with Lime."" This recipe specifically calls for using head-on fish, such as gray or pink snapper, black sea bass, or branzino, which must be scaled and gutted.

Here are the details:

### Ingredients
* 1 5-pound, two 2 1/2-pound, or three 1 1/2-pound head-on fish, such as gray or pink snapper, black sea bass, or branzino, scaled, gutted
* Kosher salt
* 1/4 cup olive oil plus more for oiling and drizzling
* 2 limes or 5 Key limes (preferably from Mexico), thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
* 1/2 bunch each basil and cilantro, stems and leaves separated

### Instructions
1. Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. Score fish: Cut 1 slash lengthwise down to the bone, then crosswise in 2 places, spacing apart; repeat on other side. Season fish cavity and skin with salt; drizzle fish with 1/4 cup oil. Stuff some of the lime slices (reserve a few for garnish) and herb stems inside fish.
2. Clean and oil grill grate well. Grill fish, resisting the urge to turn it, until skin is nicely crisp and charred and flesh is flaky and opaque down to the bone. (This can take 6-15 minutes, depending on size of fish. Don't mess around with it until it's ready.) Place a metal spatula underneath fish (a pair of metal tongs on top of fish also helps for support), then lift and gently roll over to the other side. Cook until flesh is flaky and opaque down to the bone, 6-15 minutes. Use a small knife to check for doneness; if it slides easily through the thickest part of flesh, fish is done. If not, finish cooking fish on grill or in a 450°F oven.
3. Place fish on a serving platter; drizzle oil and lime juice over. Garnish with reserved lime slices, basil leaves, and cilantro.

"If the beans are not tender after the initial cooking time, you should continue to cook them, checking the water level frequently and adding water as needed to keep the beans barely covered. Cooking times can vary significantly due to the age and variety of the beans, so it's essential to ensure they are completely tender before concluding the cooking process.

"In the recipe for **Pasta alla Gricia**, you reserve 1 1/2 cups of pasta cooking liquid to help create a thick, glossy sauce. During the final cooking stage, you add some of the reserved cooking liquid to the skillet with the pasta, which encourages the drippings from the guanciale to emulsify and form the sauce. This technique is essential because it not only enhances the sauce's consistency but also integrates the flavors, allowing the dish to achieve the perfect texture.

### Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 6 ounces guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), cut into 3/4"" pieces
- 8 ounces rigatoni
- Kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper, preferably ground with a mortar and pestle
- 3 ounces Pecorino Romano, finely grated on the small holes of a box grater (about 3 cups)

### Instructions:
1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Cook guanciale, stirring often, until it starts to brown and crisp, 10–15 minutes; it will shrink dramatically as the fat renders. Transfer to a small bowl with a slotted spoon; reserve skillet (do not wipe out).
2. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling lightly salted water, stirring occasionally, until pasta is about halfway cooked (not quite al dente); drain, reserving 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking liquid.
3. Add 3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid to reserved skillet and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, swirling often to encourage drippings and liquid to emulsify, about 1 minute. Add pasta and cook, tossing often and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until pasta is al dente and a thick, glossy sauce forms, 5–7 minutes (this second cooking is why you undercook the pasta initially).
4. Increase heat to medium-high. Add guanciale, pepper, and two-thirds of Pecorino; toss well to combine and melt cheese. Serve pasta topped with remaining Pecorino.

"If the Chicken & Broccoli mixture becomes too dry while simmering, you can simply add a little more chicken stock to restore moisture. 

Here is a delightful Chicken & Broccoli recipe:

### Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon dry sherry
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 4 ounces thin rice sticks or rice noodles

- 3/4 cup kecap manis or 3/4 cup soy sauce mixed with 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 3/4 cup Chicken Stock
- plus more if needed

8. Pour remaining 3/4 cup cold milk into a small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over. Let sit 10 minutes. Whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large bowl. Add gelatin mixture and whisk until smooth.

9. Whisking constantly, slowly pour half of the coconut milk mixture in a thin stream into egg mixture. Pour everything back into saucepan and heat over medium-high. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is thickened and starts to bubble, then continue to cook about 1 minute more.

10. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean large bowl. Add butter and vanilla and stir to combine. Press plastic wrap against surface of mixture and chill until cool, 2 1/2–3 hours.

11. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, whip cream to medium peaks in a medium bowl. Working in 3 batches, gently fold cream into pie filling until just incorporated. Sprinkle half of the remaining toasted coconut into bottom of prepared pie shell. Carefully spoon filling over coconut, mounding it in the middle and making decorative swirls with the back of a spoon. Chill at least 2 more hours to set.

"To ensure that your cheesecake doesn't crack while baking, follow these helpful tips based on our recipes:

1. **Avoid Overmixing:** When combining your ingredients, especially when adding eggs, mix just until smooth. Overmixing introduces air into the batter, leading to excessive bubbling and ultimately cracking as the cheesecake bakes.

2. **Bake at a Lower Temperature:** Many cheesecakes are baked at lower temperatures (like 200°F for the Espresso Cheesecake) to prevent the outer edges from cooking too quickly compared to the center. This helps maintain a uniform cooking temperature throughout.

3. **Cool Slowly:** After the cheesecake is done baking, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door ajar for a slow cooling period. This gradual decrease in temperature reduces the risk of cracks.

4. **Water Bath:** Some recipes suggest using a water bath. Baking the cheesecake in a pan filled with hot water helps regulate the baking temperature and maintain moisture, which can also reduce the chances of cracks.

"The texture of the cookie mixture before pressing it into the springform pan for the Banana Split Ice Cream Cake should resemble wet sand. This means that when you mix the cookie crumbs with coconut oil and salt, it should feel crumbly but can hold together when squeezed, indicating it is adequately coated in oil.

### Ingredients:
- 2 (9-ounce) packages chocolate wafer cookies
- 1 cup virgin coconut oil, melted
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 4 large ripe bananas (about 1 1/2 pounds), cut into 2"" pieces
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 5 pints vanilla ice cream, softened at room temperature 10 minutes, divided
- 1 3/4 cups maraschino cherries (from two 10-ounce jars), drained, patted dry, stems removed, plus more with stems for serving
- 2 1/4 teaspoons powdered unflavored gelatin (from one 1/4-ounce envelope)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3 cups heavy cream
- 1/3 cup salted, roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped
- A 9"" springform pan

### Instructions:
1. Pulse cookies in a food processor until coarsely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and add coconut oil and salt. Mix with your hands until crumbs are coated in oil and mixture resembles wet sand.
2. Press 2 cups cookie crumbs into the bottom of springform pan and freeze until ready to use. Spread out remaining crumbs on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet in an even layer (do not press). Freeze crumbs on baking sheet 30 minutes, then crumble into very small pieces with your hands. Freeze until ready to use.
3. Bring sugar and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cook, swirling pan occasionally, until caramel is a deep amber color, 8–10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add bananas a few pieces at a time, stirring between additions. Add cream and salt and cook, stirring often, until bananas are almost entirely broken down (only a few chunks should remain), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool.
4. Mix 2 1/2 pints ice cream in a large bowl with a wooden spoon until it resembles thick cake batter (it should be soft but not melted). Fold in 1 1/2 cups cookie crumble with a rubber spatula and scrape into pan with cookie crust; smooth top. Sprinkle 1 cup cookie crumble over ice cream, pressing lightly to adhere. Working quickly, scrape caramel-banana jam over cookie crumble and spread evenly. Top caramel with 1 cup cookie crumble. Freeze 20 minutes.
5. Mix remaining 2 1/2 pints ice cream in the same bowl to cake-batter consistency. Fold in 1 3/4 cups cherries. Scrape into pan over cookie crumble and smooth top (it may come up over the edge of the pan). Top with remaining cookie crumble. Freeze cake until frozen, about 3 hours (or overnight).
6. Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Let sit 5 minutes to soften. Add sugar and bring to a bare simmer, stirring to dissolve gelatin and sugar. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a large bowl and whisk in cream. Beat to medium peaks.
7. Unmold cake (run a knife around the edge to help release, if needed) and transfer to a platter. Spread three-quarters of whipped cream over sides and top of cake. Use remaining whipped cream to create dramatic height, swirling decoratively. Top with nuts and cherries with stems. Freeze cake at least 2 hours before serving. Slice with a warm knife.
8. Cake can be frosted 1 day ahead; freeze uncovered.

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 ounces sliced pancetta, diced
- 1/4 cup minced shallot
- 3 cups diced ripe cantaloupe (from 1 medium cantaloupe)

### Ingredients:
- 1 2-inch piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced
- 1 fresh red chile (such as Fresno or Holland), coarsely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, smashed
- 1/2 cup mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup sake
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 4 salmon collars (about 3 pounds total), scaled, fins removed
- Kosher salt
- Vegetable oil (for grill)

### Instructions:
1. Prepare a grill for medium heat. You want moderate heat for fatty fish like salmon so the fat can slowly render while the skin gets nice and crisp. Clean the grate well with a wire brush. Just before you set salmon on the grill, fold up a paper towel and hold it with a pair of long tongs. Dip the paper towel in oil and wipe down the grate.
2. Remove the salmon from the marinade, allowing the excess to drip back; discard the marinade. Grill the salmon, skin side down, brushing occasionally with the reserved tare, until the skin is lightly charred and crisp, about 5–7 minutes. Turn the salmon and grill until the other side is lightly charred (don’t brush this side with tare), for about 5 minutes. Transfer salmon collars to a platter.

"If you don't have a kitchen blowtorch to caramelize the top, you can use your oven's broiler instead. Here’s a method you can follow along with the recipe that includes how to make the caramel sauce:

### Ingredients for Caramel Sauce:
- 28 grams or 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 87 grams or 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (89 ml) heavy cream
- 200 grams or 1 cup sugar, preferably superfine
- 41 grams or 2 tablespoons (30 ml) corn syrup
- 3/8 teaspoon cream of tartar (optional)
- 59 grams or 1/4 cup (59 ml) water
- 2 teaspoons (10 ml) pure vanilla extract

### Instructions for Caramel Sauce:
1. About 30 minutes ahead, cut the butter into a few pieces and set it on the counter at room temperature (65º to 75ºF/19º to 24ºC).
2. Into a 1 cup glass measure with a spout, weigh or measure the cream. Heat in the microwave until hot, then cover it.
3. Have ready a 2 cup glass measure with a spout, lightly coated with nonstick cooking spray, near the cooktop.
4. In a heavy 6 cup saucepan, preferably nonstick, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, cream of tartar (if using), and water until all the sugar is moistened.
5. Heat, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula, until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling. Stop stirring and let it boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber and the temperature reaches 370ºF/188ºC or a few degrees below; remove it from the heat as soon as it reaches temperature.
6. Slowly and carefully pour the hot cream into the caramel; it will bubble up furiously.
7. Use a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to stir the mixture gently, scraping the thicker part that settles on the bottom. Return it to a very low heat, continuing to stir gently for 1 minute, until the mixture is uniform in color and the caramel is fully dissolved.
8. Remove the caramel from the heat and gently stir in the butter until incorporated. The mixture will be a little streaky but will become uniform once cooled and stirred.
9. Pour the caramel into the prepared glass measure and let it cool for 3 minutes. Gently stir in the vanilla and let it cool until room temperature and thickened, stirring it gently once or twice.

After you've prepared the caramel sauce, pour it over your dessert and place it under the broiler for a few minutes to achieve that beautifully caramelized top!

"To layer the ingredients in jars for a Greek salad, you can follow these steps based on the **Greek-Style Salad** recipe:

### Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound beefsteak tomatoes, cut into 1-inch-thick wedges
- 1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced crosswise
- 1 head radicchio (1/2 pound), halved lengthwise, then thinly sliced crosswise
- 1 head romaine, coarsely chopped (6 cups)
- 2 small cucumbers, peeled if desired, halved lengthwise, then thinly sliced crosswise
- 2/3 cup mixed Greek olives (1/4 pound)

### Instructions
1. Whisk together lemon juice, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl until sugar and salt have dissolved.
2. Add oil and whisk until combined well. Stir in tomatoes and onion and let stand for 10 minutes.

"For the recipe ""Pumpkin Stuffed with Everything Good,"" I recommend using a **fresh pumpkin** rather than canned pumpkin. The recipe specifically calls for a whole pumpkin, which is prepped and cooked in the oven, providing the best texture and flavor.

Here are the details:

### Ingredients:
- 1 pumpkin, about 3 pounds
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1/4 pound stale bread, thinly sliced and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
- 1/4 pound cheese, such as Gruyère, Emmenthal, cheddar, or a combination, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
- 2-4 garlic cloves (to taste), split, germ removed, and coarsely chopped
- 4 slices bacon, cooked until crisp, drained, and chopped (my addition)
- About 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or sliced scallions (my addition)
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme (my addition)
- About 1/3 cup heavy cream
- Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg

### Instructions:
1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that's just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin. If you bake the pumpkin in a casserole, it will keep its shape, but it might stick to the casserole, so you'll have to serve it from the pot—which is an appealingly homey way to serve it. If you bake it on a baking sheet, you can present it freestanding, but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn't so easy. However, since I love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table, I've always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method, and so far, I've been lucky.

2. Using a very sturdy knife—and caution—cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (think Halloween Jack-o-Lantern). It's easiest to work your knife around the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle. You want to cut off enough of the top to make it easy for you to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot.

3. Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepper—you probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese, but taste to be sure—and pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well filled—you might have a little too much filling, or you might need to add to it. Stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin. Again, you might have too much or too little—you don't want the ingredients to swim in cream, but you do want them nicely moistened. (It's hard to go wrong here.)

4. Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours—check after 90 minutes—or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, I like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little.

5. When the pumpkin is ready, carefully, very carefully—it's heavy, hot, and wobbly—bring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you'll bring to the table.

6. You have a choice—you can either spoon out portions of the filling, making sure to get a generous amount of pumpkin into the spoonful, or you can dig into the pumpkin with a big spoon, pull the pumpkin meat into the filling, and then mix everything up. I'm a fan of the pull-and-mix option. Served in hearty portions followed by a salad, the pumpkin is a perfect cold-weather main course; served in generous spoonfuls, it's just right alongside the Thanksgiving turkey.

7. It's really best to eat this as soon as it's ready. However, if you've got leftovers, you can scoop them out of the pumpkin, mix them up, cover, and chill them; reheat them the next day.

8. There are many ways to vary this arts-and-crafts project. Instead of bread, I've filled the pumpkin with cooked rice—when it's baked, it's almost risotto-like. And, with either bread or rice, on different occasions I've added cooked spinach, kale, chard, or peas (the peas came straight from the freezer). I've made it without bacon (a wonderful vegetarian dish), and I've also made it and loved, loved, loved it with cooked sausage meat; cubes of ham are also a good idea. Nuts are a great addition, as are chunks of apple or pear or pieces of chestnut.

"To enhance the flavor of your chicken stock, you should consider leaving the herbs in the cavities of the chicken before you cook it. This will infuse the stock with aromatic flavors as it simmers.

Here are the details of the recipe:

### Ingredients:
- 12 cups water
- 8 garlic cloves
- 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced
- 4 whole star anise
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
- 1 (4-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces
- 4 carrots
- 4 celery stalks
- 2 unpeeled white or red onions, halved
- Salt, for seasoning
- Chopped parsley leaves and lemon wedges, for serving

### Instructions:
1. Wipe the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking. Build a two-zone fire. Your high-heat zone should have embers 1 to 2 inches from the cooking surface, with occasional flames licking it. To create your medium-heat zone, nudge the embers 2 to 3 inches lower than that.
2. Fill a stockpot with the water, garlic, ginger, star anise, bay leaves, and peppercorns and place over medium heat. Place the chicken, carrots, celery, and onions over high heat and cook, turning occasionally, until well charred all over, about 15 minutes total. When each ingredient is done, add it to the pot (it’s important that each ingredient be very well browned—almost burnt—before adding to the pot). Cook the stock for at least 3 hours, adding additional water if necessary to keep the meat and vegetables covered. Season with salt at the end.
3. Remove the pot from heat. Remove the chicken pieces and shred the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Strain the stock, discarding solids.
4. To serve, place a pile of shredded chicken into each bowl and cover with hot stock. Pass the parsley and lemon wedges separately. The stock can be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.

"When roasting potatoes, the specific arrangement is important for achieving the best texture. According to the recipe for **Perfectly Roasted Potatoes**, you should arrange the potatoes cut side down on the baking sheet, spacing them evenly. This allows the cut sides to brown nicely and develop a crisp texture.

### Ingredients:
- 2 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions:
1. Place a rack in the lowest position in your oven and preheat to 425°F. Halve potatoes lengthwise.
2. Arrange potatoes, cut side down, on a large rimmed baking sheet, spacing evenly. Pour in 1 1/2 to 2 cups water—enough to cover the surface in a thin layer but not so much that it spills the second you move the sheet.
3. Cover baking sheet with a double layer of foil, crimping sides very tightly to seal well. This will trap in steam and prevent water from sloshing out if you accidentally jostle the sheet.
4. Bake until a fork or a skewer slides easily through the potatoes, 25 to 30 minutes. The foil will be puffed; pierce it with the fork or skewer and poke around for a couple of potatoes to test.
5. Let potatoes cool, still covered, for 5 minutes. Use tongs to peel back foil about 1 inch at one corner. Carefully tip the sheet and pour off water (its job is done). Crank up oven to 500°F or as high as it goes.
6. Remove foil. Drizzle olive oil over potatoes. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Let potatoes cool to the point that you can handle them, then toss to coat.
7. Arrange potatoes cut side down and roast, uncovered, until skins are golden, cut sides are deeply browned and crisp, and you can see the edges frying and sizzling in the oil on the sheet, 20–25 minutes.
8. Let potatoes cool for a minute or two, then use a spatula to unstick them from the baking sheet. Serve them exactly as they are because these potatoes need absolutely nothing else.

"The cooking time for the noodles once they rise to the surface of the boiling water is **1 1/2 to 2 minutes**.

### Rice Noodles
#### Ingredients:
* 4 cups rice flour, plus more for dusting
* 3 1/2 cups water
* 3 tablespoons shallot oil or canola oil
* 1 cup tapioca starch

#### Instructions: 
1. In a bowl, whisk together the rice flour and 3 1/2 cups water until smooth. Cover and allow to ferment at room temperature for 4 days.
2. Carefully pour out 1 1/2 cups water from the settled rice flour. Add 1/4 cup fresh water to the batter and stir until smooth.
3. Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Keep the water hot while you prepare the dough.
4. In a heavy-bottomed 4- to 6-quart pot, heat the oil over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the batter and turn down the heat to low. This is a two-person job: one person needs to stabilize the pot while the other one quickly and firmly stirs the batter with a wooden spoon. The dough will begin to thicken. Continue cooking, stirring continuously, for 5 to 8 minutes, until the dough is a thick, firm paste. If any dough sticks to the sides of the pot, do not scrape it off.
5. Transfer the dough to a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and add tapioca starch. Mix on medium speed for about 10 minutes, until it forms a sticky ball.
6. Bring the water back to a boil, then adjust the heat to keep it at a vigorous simmer. While the water is heating, dust a clean work surface with flour, transfer the dough to it, and knead for another 5 minutes, until smooth. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.
7. Prepare a large ice-water bath and place it near the stove. Put 1 1/2 cups of the dough into a potato ricer, keeping the remaining dough covered. Position the ricer directly above the center of the pot of boiling water and press firmly to extrude the noodles. As you press, smoothly lower the ricer close to the water and shake it gently from side to side to break the ends of the noodles free, allowing the noodles to fall into the simmering water. Simmer the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until they bunch up to one side of the pot. With a spider or tongs, carefully transfer the noodles to the ice-water bath. Once cool, transfer to a colander and let drain. Repeat with the remaining dough, replacing the ice water as needed. When all the noodles have been cooked and cooled, rinse the noodles under cold running water to remove excess starch. Drain the noodles. The noodles are best used the same day they are made, but they can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day.

"If the pan juices dry out while roasting the lamb, simply add a little more wine to the roasting pan to keep the moisture levels up.

### Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons coarse sea salt
* 2 teaspoons dried Greek oregano or savory
* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
* 3 teaspoons caraway seeds
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 tablespoons Harissa or Aleppo or Maras pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon chopped garlic
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* One 5-to 6-pound bone-in leg of lamb
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
* 1/3 cup dry white wine, or more if needed
* 1½ pounds medium or small red onions, peeled and halved or quartered
* 2 or 3 fresh rosemary sprigs or 1 tablespoon dried

### Instructions
1. In a spice grinder, a clean coffee grinder, or a mortar, grind the salt, oregano, rosemary, caraway, cumin, and turmeric to a fine powder. Transfer to a bowl and add the harissa and chopped garlic. Add the olive oil to make a thick paste. Make 8 or 9 deep slits all over the lamb and insert some of the spice paste, rubbing the paste all over the surface of the meat. Cover and let stand for 1 hour at room temperature or, preferably, refrigerate for at least 5 hours or overnight. Bring to room temperature before roasting.

2. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the leg of lamb fat side down in a roasting pan that will hold the onions in one layer. Roast for 20 minutes. Mix the lemon juice and wine in a small bowl. Turn the meat and pour the lemon-wine mixture over it. (If you are roasting the lamb in a clay dish, warm the mixture first, because cold liquid can cause the clay to crack.) Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and roast for 35 minutes, basting every 10 to 15 minutes with the pan juices. If the pan dries out, add a little more wine.

3. Transfer the lamb to a plate and add the onions to the pan, tossing them well to coat them with the pan juices. Add the rosemary sprigs or sprinkle with dried rosemary, toss, place the lamb on the onions, and continue roasting, basting often, for another 30 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads 135°F. Transfer the meat to a heated platter, cover with a double layer of aluminum foil, and set aside. (Leave the oven on.) If the pan juices are watery, transfer most of them to a saucepan and cook briefly to reduce.

4. Meanwhile, return the pan to the oven and continue baking the onions until tender, with browned edges. Turn the oven to broil. Place the lamb on the onions again and broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the surface is deep brown and crackling. Carve the lamb and serve, passing the pan juices in a bowl or sauceboat at the table.

"In the **Mirror Cake Glaze** recipe, stirring the gelatin with lukewarm water before using it serves to ""bloom"" the gelatin. This process allows the gelatin to absorb water and swell, which is essential for it to dissolve properly when heated in the glaze mixture. If the gelatin isn't bloomed, it may not dissolve efficiently, leading to a lumpy glaze.

### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (3 packets)
* 1 3/4 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 1/2 cups white chocolate chips (about 15 ounces)
* 3–4 different shades of food coloring

### Instructions
1. Stir gelatin and 1/2 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl and let sit 5 minutes.
2. Cook sugar, condensed milk, vanilla, salt, and 3/4 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Add bloomed gelatin and stir until dissolved.
3. Remove from heat and add chocolate chips, stirring constantly, until melted. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, then divide glaze among 3 or 4 bowls. Color each with food coloring as desired. Let cool, stirring occasionally to stop a skin from forming, until glaze is just cool enough to touch (100–95°F), 10–12 minutes.
4. Pour half of color one into a large bowl, then pour half of color two into the center, followed by half of color three and half of color four, if using. Repeat with remaining glaze to form concentric circles of different colors in bowl.
5. Set a chilled, smoothly frosted cake on a cake pan or overturned bowl set inside a rimmed baking sheet or large tray to catch drips. Pour colored glaze over, sweeping back and forth across cake as you pour, to form a marbled pattern. Resist the temptation to touch glaze once it’s poured; it will start to set as soon as it hits the cold cake. Let glaze drip about 10 minutes, then clean up edges with a small offset spatula or butter knife. Transfer cake to a serving platter and chill at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day.
6. Using a warmed sharp knife, cut cleanly through cake, wiping knife with a warm damp towel between each slice.

"To prepare the carrots for the **Spicy Carrot-Miso Dressing** without a high-powered blender, you should grate the carrots instead of chopping them. Here’s how you can prepare the ingredients and instructions for the dressing:

### Ingredients:
* 2 medium carrots, grated
* 1/2 cup filtered water
* 1/4 cup raw cashews
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 Tbsp. freshly squeezed lime juice
* 1 (3-inch) piece scallion, white and light green parts only, coarsely chopped
* 1 (1/2-inch) slice of a large garlic clove
* 1/2 tsp. fine sea salt, plus more to taste
* 1 tsp. tamari, plus more to taste
* 1 recipe Creamy Carrot Dressing, omitting the salt and using brown rice vinegar in place of the lime juice
* 1 Tbsp. unpasteurized chickpea miso or sweet white miso
* 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped (finely chopped if using a regular blender)
* 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, plus more to taste

### Instructions:
1. Combine the grated carrots, water, cashews, olive oil, lime juice, scallion, garlic, salt, and tamari in an upright blender and blend until completely smooth; this will take at least 1 minute. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and blend again. Adjust the seasoning to taste and blend again. Use immediately, or store in a glass jar in the fridge for up to 3 days. Shake well before using. The dressing will thicken once chilled; thin it out with a little water if needed.
2. Make the dressing following the instructions for the base recipe, adding the miso, ginger, and cayenne to the blender along with the other ingredients. Adjust the seasoning with cayenne as well as more salt to taste.

"You can add **Parmesan rinds** to the broth to adjust its richness. This is an optional ingredient used in the **Parmesan Broth** recipe.

Here's the full recipe for your reference:

### Parmesan Broth
**Ingredients:**
- 1 halved head of garlic
- 1 quartered onion
- Olive oil, enough to sauté garlic and onion
- 1 handful of thyme
- Sprigs of parsley
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 shake of black peppercorns
- 1 cup of dry white wine
- 1 pound Parmesan rinds
- 8 cups of water

**Instructions:**
1. I start by sautéing a halved head of garlic and a quartered onion in some olive oil, along with a handful of thyme, a few sprigs of parsley, a bay leaf, and a shake of black peppercorns. Once the garlic is browned, I add a cup of dry white wine and simmer, scraping the pot to get the brown bits loosened up, until reduced by half. In goes 1 pound Parmesan rinds and 8 cups of water.
2. The whole thing simmers until it tastes robust and has reduced by half, about 2 hours. (I stir every now and then—the rinds will stick to the bottom of the pot if you let them.) I strain, and then use the broth in vegetable soups, instant-supper pastas, and beans in need of a boost. Then I start hoarding all over again.
